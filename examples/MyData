"Survival among lung cancer patients: comparison of the U.S. military health system and the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) program by health insurance status","Purpose: The U.S. military health system (MHS) provides beneficiaries with universal health care while health care access varies in the U.S. general population by insurance status/type. We divided the patients from the U.S. general population by insurance status/type and compared them to the MHS patients in survival. Methods: The MHS patients were identified from the Department of Defense’s Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR). Patients from the U.S. general population were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was conducted to compare different insurance status/type in SEER to ACTUR in overall survival. Results: Compared to ACTUR patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), SEER patients showed significant worse survival. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were 1.08 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.03–1.13], 1.22 (95% CI = 1.16–1.28), 1.40 (95% CI = 1.33–1.47), 1.50 (95% CI = 1.41–1.59), for insured, insured/no specifics, Medicaid, and uninsured patients, respectively. The pattern was consistently observed in subgroup analysis by race, gender, age, or tumor stage. Results were similar for small cell lung cancer (SCLC), although they were only borderline significant in some subgroups. Conclusion: The survival advantage of patients receiving care from a universal health care system over the patients from the general population was not restricted to uninsured or Medicaid as expected, but was present cross all insurance types, including patients with private insurance. Our findings highlight the survival benefits of universal health care system to lung cancer patients.","['Lin, J.', 'Shriver, C.D.', 'Zhu, K.']",10.1007/s10552-023-01765-0
Racial/Ethnic disparities in exposure to neighborhood violence and lung cancer risk in Chicago,"Background: Despite the lower prevalence and frequency of smoking, Black adults are disproportionately affected by lung cancer. Exposure to chronic stress generates heightened immune responses, which creates a cell environment conducive to lung cancer development. Residents in poor and segregated neighborhoods are exposed to increased neighborhood violence, and chronic exposure to violence may have downstream physiological stress responses, which may explain racial disparities in lung cancer in predominantly Black urban communities. Methods: We utilized retrospective electronic medical records of patients who underwent a screening or diagnostic test for lung cancer at an academic medical center in Chicago to examine the associations between lung cancer diagnosis and individual characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and smoking status) and neighborhood-level homicide rate. We then used a synthetic population to estimate the neighborhood-level lung cancer risk to understand spatial clusters of increased homicide rates and lung cancer risk. Results: Older age and former/current smoking status were associated with increased odds of lung cancer diagnosis. Hispanic patients were more likely than White patients to be diagnosed with lung cancer, but there was no statistical difference between Black and White patients in lung cancer diagnosis. The odds of being diagnosed with lung cancer were significantly higher for patients living in areas with the third and fourth quartiles of homicide rates compared to the second quartile of homicide rates. Furthermore, significant spatial clusters of increased lung cancer risk and homicide rates were observed on Chicago's South and West sides. Conclusions: Neighborhood violence was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. Black residents in Chicago are disproportionately exposed to neighborhood violence, which may partially explain the existing racial disparity in lung cancer. Incorporating neighborhood violence exposure into lung cancer risk models may help identify high-risk individuals who could benefit from lung cancer screening.","['Kim, S.J.', 'Kery, C.', 'An, J.', 'Bobashev, G.', 'Matthews, A.K.']",10.1016/j.socscimed.2023.116448
Status and Correlated Factors with Suicidal Ideation Among Patients with Lung Cancer: Evidence from Vietnam,"Objective: This study described the rate of suicidal ideation in lung cancer patients and identify associated factors. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2021 to October 2022 at the Nuclear Medicine and Oncology Center – Bach Mai Hospital, Hanoi, Vietnam. A total of 256 patients completed the survey. The Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was used to measure suicidal ideation. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was utilized to evaluate depression and anxiety. Socio-demographic characteristics, clinical features and pain severity were also measured. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. Results: There was 8.2% having suicidal ideation. Among patients with suicidal ideation, the mean score of intensity subscale was 13.33 ± 4.98, and mean scores on intensity scale items were as follows: frequency (mean=2.86 ± 1.32). duration (mean=2.29 ± 1.15), controllability (mean=2.67 ± 1.28), deterrents (mean=2.48 ± 1.21), and reason for ideation (mean=3,05 ± 1,63). Being female (OR=3.36, 95%CI=1.35-8.37), having severxe pain (OR=5.91, 95%CI=1.65-21.18), having depression (OR=10.36, 95%CI=3.93-27.39) and having anxiety (OR=7.81, 95%CI=3.05-20.01) were positively associated with the likelihood of having suicidal ideation among lung cancer patients. Conclusion: Findings revealed the high prevalence of suicidal ideation among individuals diagnosed with lung cancer in Vietnam. Notably, this trend was more pronounced among female patients, those with severe pain, and individuals experiencing mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. Practitioners ought to prioritize the screening and intervention processes for lung cancer patients with a high risk of suicidal tendencies.","['Van Tuan, N.', 'Ha, L.T.T.', 'Hung, P.Q.', 'Thien, L.C.', 'Hue, D.T.', 'Yen, N.H.', 'Hoa, N.T.', 'Tai, L.P.', 'Long, N.T.', 'Thang, P.X.', 'Thanh, N.H.']",10.1016/j.jadr.2023.100712
Survival outcomes for lung neuroendocrine tumors in California differ by sociodemographic factors,"Lung neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have few known predictors of survival. We investigated associations of sociodemographic, clinicopathologic, and treatment factors with overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) for incident lung NET cases (typical or atypical histology) in the California Cancer Registry (CCR) from 1992 to 2019. OS was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared by sociodemographic and disease factors univariately with the log-rank test. We used sequential Cox proportional hazards regression for multivariable OS analysis. LCSS was estimated using Fine-Gray competing risks regression. There were 6038 lung NET diagnoses (5569 typical, 469 atypical carcinoid); most were women (70%) and non-Hispanic White (73%). In our multivariable model, sociodemographic factors were independently associated with OS, with better survival for women (hazard ratio (HR) 0.62, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.68, P < 0.001), married (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.70-0.84, P < 0.001), and residents of high socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods (HRQ5vsQ1 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.85, P < 0.001). Compared to cases with private insurance, OS was worse for cases with Medicare (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10-1.40, P < 0.001) or Medicaid/other public insurance (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.24-1.68, P < 0.001). In our univariate model, non-Hispanic Black Californians had worse OS than other racial/ethnic groups, but differences attenuated after adjusting for stage at diagnosis. In our LCSS models, we found similar associations between sex and marital status on survival, but no differences in outcomes by SES or insurance. By race/ethnicity, American Indian cases had worse LCSS. In summary, beyond disease-related and treatment variables, sociodemographic factors were independently associated with survival in lung NETs.","['Mulvey, C.K.', 'Paciorek, A.', 'Moon, F.', 'Steiding, P.', 'Shih, B.', 'Gubens, M.A.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Bergsland, E.K.', 'Cheng, I.']",10.1530/ERC-23-0068
Socio-economic inequalities in lung cancer mortality in Spain: a nation-wide study using area-based deprivation,"Background: Lung cancer is the main cause of cancer mortality worldwide and in Spain. Several previous studies have documented socio-economic inequalities in lung cancer mortality but these have focused on specific provinces or cities. The goal of this study was to describe lung cancer mortality in Spain by sex as a function of socio-economic deprivation. Methods: We analysed all registered deaths from lung cancer during the period 2011–2017 in Spain. Mortality data was obtained from the National Institute of Statistics, and socio-economic level was measured with the small-area deprivation index developed by the Spanish Society of Epidemiology, with the census tract of residence at the time of death as the unit of analysis. We computed crude and age-standardized rates per 100,000 inhabitants by sex, deprivation quintile, and type of municipality (rural, semi-rural, urban) considering the 2013 European standard population (ASR-E). We further calculated ASR-E ratios between the most deprived (Q5) and the least deprived (Q1) areas and mapped census tract smoothed standardized lung cancer mortality ratios by sex. Results: We observed 148,425 lung cancer deaths (80.7% in men), with 73.5 deaths per 100,000 men and 17.1 deaths per 100,000 women. Deaths from lung cancer in men were five times more frequent than in women (ASR-E ratio = 5.3). Women residing in the least deprived areas had higher mortality from lung cancer (ASR-E = 22.2), compared to women residing in the most deprived areas (ASR-E = 13.2), with a clear gradient among the quintiles of deprivation. For men, this pattern was reversed, with the highest mortality occurring in areas of lower socio-economic level (ASR-E = 99.0 in Q5 vs. ASR-E = 86.6 in Q1). These socio-economic inequalities remained fairly stable over time and across urban and rural areas. Conclusions: Socio-economic status is strongly related to lung cancer mortality, showing opposite patterns in men and women, such that mortality is highest in women residing in the least deprived areas and men residing in the most deprived areas. Systematic surveillance of lung cancer mortality by socio-economic status may facilitate the assessment of public health interventions aimed at mitigating cancer inequalities in Spain.","['Redondo-Sánchez, D.', 'Fernández-Navarro, P.', 'Rodríguez-Barranco, M.', 'Nuñez, O.', 'Petrova, D.', 'García-Torrecillas, J.M.', 'Jiménez-Moleón, J.J.', 'Sánchez, M.-J.']",10.1186/s12939-023-01970-y
Lung RADS: Lessons Learned and Strategies for the Optimization of Lung Cancer Screening,"Purpose of Review: Lung cancer screening (LCS) using low-dose chest CT (LDCT) has been shown to decrease lung cancer specific morbidity and mortality (Jonas et al. in JAMA 325(10):971–87, 2021•). We aim to discuss important current and evolving concepts related to LCS, including major updates to the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations and to the lexicon used by radiologists in the reporting of LCS LDCT, the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS). Recent Findings: The number of individuals eligible to receive LCS has increased following the latest update to USPSTF recommendations, notably among women, minorities, and individuals of lower socioeconomic status (Ritzwoller et al. in JAMA Netw Open 4(10):e2128176, 2021). Since the inception of LCS programs, emerging evidence has allowed for updates to the Lung-RADS guidelines aimed at optimizing LCS efficiency and addressing various challenging clinical scenarios. Summary: LCS has continually evolved since its debut. Updated guidelines aim at improving outcomes in the at-risk population. Nevertheless, continued efforts focused on increased LCS uptake are needed. Less than 6% of the eligible population is currently enrolled in a LCS program nationwide, while screening programs for breast and colon cancer have participation rates of 60–70% (New Report: Critically Low Lung Cancer Screening Rates Reveal Opportunity to Save More Lives. American Lung Association, 2022; Hall in Prev Chronic Dis 15, 2018).","['Herring, A.', 'Chelala, L.', 'White, C.S.']",10.1007/s13665-023-00325-w
MicroRNA biomarkers and their use in evaluating the prognosis of lung cancer,"Objective: We aim to use the microRNA (miRNA, micro-ribonucleic acid) data of lung cancer tissues to establish a miRNA biomarker database for lung cancer that can be used for marker screening and analysis of lung cancer prognosis. Methods: We obtained lung cancer-related data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and analyzed the miRNA expression profiles of lung cancer tissues and normal tissues using bioinformatics techniques to develop a new composite miRNA-based model for the prognostic assessment of lung cancer. The predictive power of this model was verified and evaluated based on grouping of data. We also performed RT-qPCR using lung cancer tissues from patients diagnosed with lung cancer. Results: There was a significant difference between the miRNA expression profiles of lung cancer tissues and normal tissues adjacent to the cancerous lesions. The prognostic survival of patients with lung cancer was closely related to onset age and staging (p = 0.012) but was not related to gender (p = 0.39) and race (p = 0.51). Using three methods of survival model construction, we identified three miRNA composites, namely hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-141, and has-mir-490, as markers for the prognosis of lung cancer. As confirmed by RT-qPCR, the expressions of hsa-miR-21-5p and hsa-miR-141-5p were upregulated, whereas hsa-miR-490-3p expression was downregulated in lung cancer lesion tissues. Conclusion: The three miRNA composites identified, namely hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-141, and hsa-mir-490, have the potential to serve as novel prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer.","['Wu, R.', 'Zhang, B.', 'He, M.', 'Kang, Y.', 'Zhang, G.']",10.1007/s00432-023-05404-8
"Emotional Distress, Anxiety, and General Health Status in Patients With Newly Identified Small Pulmonary Nodules: Results From the Watch the Spot Trial","Background: Anxiety and emotional distress have not been studied in large, diverse samples of patients with pulmonary nodules. Research Question: How common are anxiety and distress in patients with newly identified pulmonary nodules, and what factors are associated with these outcomes? Study Design and Methods: This study surveyed participants in the Watch the Spot Trial, a large, pragmatic clinical trial of more vs less intensive strategies for radiographic surveillance of patients with small pulmonary nodules. The survey included validated instruments to measure patient-centered outcomes such as nodule-related emotional distress (Impact of Event Scale-Revised) and anxiety (Six-Item State Anxiety Inventory) 6 to 8 weeks following nodule identification. Mixed-effects models were used to compare outcomes between study arms following adjustment for potential confounders and clustering within enrollment site, while also examining a limited number of prespecified explanatory factors, including nodule size, mode of detection, type of ordering clinician, and lack of timely notification prior to contact by the study team. Results: The trial enrolled 34,699 patients; 2,049 individuals completed the baseline survey (5.9%). Respondents and nonrespondents had similar demographic and nodule characteristics, although more respondents were non-Hispanic and White. Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores indicated mild, moderate, or severe distress in 32.2%, 9.4%, and 7.2% of respondents, respectively, with no difference in scores between study arms. Following adjustment, greater emotional distress was associated with larger nodule size and lack of timely notification by a clinician; distress was also associated with younger age, female sex, ever smoking, Black race, and Hispanic ethnicity. Anxiety was associated with lack of timely notification, ever smoking, and female sex. Interpretation: Almost one-half of respondents experienced emotional distress 6 to 8 weeks following pulmonary nodule identification. Strategies are needed to mitigate the burden of distress, especially in younger, female, ever smoking, and minoritized patients, and those with larger nodules.

Social vulnerability and lung malignancy mortality,"Introduction: Lung cancer is a major cause of death in the United States. Social determinants of health (SDOH) are important factors that impact the treatment and prognosis of lung cancer. The social vulnerability index (SVI) is a validated measure of SDOH. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the impact of the SVI on lung cancer mortality using descriptive epidemiology. Methods: Mortality data for lung malignancies from 2014 to 2018 was obtained from the CDC database and was age-adjusted and standardized to the population in the year 2000. The SVI for the same years was obtained from the CDC Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry database. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) were estimated for each SVI quartile (SVI-Q) and demographic subgroup. Results: We found that counties in SVI-Q4 (most vulnerable) had a higher cumulative AAMR compared to counties in SVI-Q1 (least vulnerable), accounting for a 4.48 excess death rate per 100,000 person-years. AAMR among males in SVI-Q4 was higher compared to SVI-Q1, accounting for a 9.96 excess death rate per 100,000 person-years, whereas no mortality differences were observed for female populations between SVI-Q4 and SVI-Q1. AAMR in SVI-Q4 was higher for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations, except for American Indian/Alaska Native populations. Similar trends were observed in both metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the SVI may play a significant role in lung cancer mortality and highlights the need for interventions targeting vulnerable populations to improve outcomes.","['Ibrahim, R.', 'Sakr, L.', 'Lewis, J.A.', 'Kim, R.Y.', 'Benn, B.S.', 'Low, S.-W.']",10.1016/j.jcpo.2023.100453
Black Race Remains Associated with Lower Eligibility for Screening Using 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations Among Lung Cancer Patients at an Urban Safety Net Hospital,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the revised US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria reduced inequities in lung cancer screening (LCS) eligibility among a racially diverse sample of patients with lung cancer. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of adults diagnosed with primary lung malignancies at an urban safety net hospital. For all patients and exclusively ever-smokers, χ2 tests were used to evaluate differences in LCS eligibility among socio-demographic variables using the 2013 and 2021 USPSTF criteria. Patients who were ineligible for LCS were categorized by reason for exclusion. RESULTS: Among 678 lung cancer patients (46% female, mean age 66 ± 10 years), 51% were White, and 39% were Black. Using the 2013 guidelines, White patients (57%) would have been more likely to be eligible than Black (37%) and other-race patients (35%) (P < 0.0001) at time of cancer diagnosis. Under the 2021 guidelines, White patients (68%) remained more likely to be eligible for LCS than Black (54%) and other-race patients (48%) (P = 0.0002). Among exclusively ever-smoking patients, we did not observe a significant difference in eligibility by race under the 2021 USPSTF guidelines (White [73%], Black [65%], and other-race [65%]; [P = 0.48]). Sex, ethnicity, education level, and insurance type were not associated with differential screening eligibility under either the 2013 or 2021 guidelines. CONCLUSION: The revised 2021 USPSTF LCS guidelines may not be sufficient to eliminate racial inequities in LCS eligibility among patients who go on to be diagnosed with primary lung cancer. Differential rates of lung cancer among never-smokers may contribute to this inequity.","['Liu, A.', 'Siddiqi, N.', 'Tapan, U.', 'Mak, K.S.', 'Steiling, K.A.', 'Suzuki, K.']",10.1007/s40615-022-01460-x
"Estimated US Cancer Deaths Prevented With Increased Use of Lung, Colorectal, Breast, and Cervical Cancer Screening","IMPORTANCE Increased use of recommended screening could help achieve the Cancer Moonshot goal of reducing US cancer deaths. OBJECTIVE To estimate the number of cancer deaths that could be prevented with a 10–percentage point increase in the use of US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)-recommended screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This decision analytical model study is an extension of previous studies conducted for the USPSTF from 2018 to 2023. This study simulated contemporary cohorts of US adults eligible for lung, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening. EXPOSURES Annual low-dose computed lung tomography among eligible adults aged 50 to 80 years; colonoscopy every 10 years among adults aged 45 to 75 years; biennial mammography among female adults aged 40 to 74 years; and triennial cervical cytology screening among female adults aged 21 to 29 years, followed by human papillomavirus testing every 5 years from ages 30 to 65 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Estimated number of cancer deaths prevented with a 10–percentage point increase in screening use, assuming screening commences at the USPSTF-recommended starting age and continues throughout the lifetime. Outcomes were presented 2 ways: (1) per 100 000 and (2) among US adults in 2021; and they were expressed among the target population at the age of screening initiation. For lung cancer, estimates were among those who will also meet the smoking eligibility criteria during their lifetime. Harms from increased uptake were also reported. RESULTS A 10–percentage point increase in screening use at the age that USPSTF recommended screening commences was estimated to prevent 226 lung cancer deaths (range across models within the cancer site, 133-332 deaths), 283 (range, 263-313) colorectal cancer deaths, 82 (range, 61-106) breast cancer deaths, and 81 (1 model; no range available) cervical cancer deaths over the lifetimes of 100 000 persons eligible for screening. These rates corresponded with an estimated 1010 (range, 590-1480) lung cancer deaths prevented, 11 070 (range, 10 280-12 250) colorectal cancer deaths prevented, 1790 (range, 1330-2310) breast cancer deaths prevented, and 1710 (no range available) cervical cancer deaths prevented over the lifetimes of eligible US residents at the recommended age to initiate screening in 2021. Increased uptake was also estimated to generate harms, including 100 000 (range, 45 000-159 000) false-positive lung scans, 6000 (range, 6000-7000) colonoscopy complications, 300 000 (range, 295 000-302 000) false-positive mammograms, and 348 000 (no range available) colposcopies over the lifetime. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this decision analytical model study, a 10–percentage point increase in uptake of USPSTF-recommended lung, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening at the recommended starting age was estimated to yield important reductions in cancer deaths. Achieving these reductions is predicated on ensuring equitable access to screening.","['Knudsen, A.B.', 'Trentham-Dietz, A.', 'Kim, J.J.', 'Mandelblatt, J.S.', 'Meza, R.', 'Zauber, A.G.', 'Castle, P.E.', 'Feuer, E.J.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.44698
Prognostic analysis of non-small cell lung cancer patients in Xinjiang Cancer Center from 2011 - 2021,"Objective To analyze the relevant factors that affect the survival time and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in Xinjiang region, and construct a prognosis prediction model for NSCLC patients. Methods A total of 9 577 NSCLC patients from the Xinjiang Cancer Center (Affiliated Oncology Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University) from 2011 to 2021 were collected for retrospective analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional risk regression models were used to analyze the prognostic factors of NSCLC patients, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves for different factors were plotted. Column charts were used to visualize the results. Used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for model validation, and evaluated model performance with the C index. Results Among 9 577 NSCLC patients, Han nationality patients accounted for 85. 26%, women (39. 14%) were less than men (60. 86%), 41.27% of patients aged<60 years old, the clinical staging was mainly stage IV (52.09%), followed by stage fH (23.06%), stage T (18. 45%), and stage fJ (6. 40%). The main types of clinical pathology were adenocarcinoma (62. 92%) and squamous cell carcinoma (22. 31%). The primary location of NSCLC was mostly in the right lung (58. 48%). There were relatively few professions such as middle school students, professional technicians, and enterprise managers in terms of occupational distribution. The results of univariate analysis showed that age, gender, race, TNM stage, T stage, N stage, M stage, pathological tissue type, and primary tumor location were statistically correlated with the prognosis of NSCLC patients, the-£-values were 160. 21, 37. 84, 294. 77, 1 993. 09, 796. 44, 1 537. 08, 1 515. 03, 178. 04 and 17. 55, respectively, all P<0. 01. Based on the aforementioned prognostic factors, constructed a Cox proportional risk regression model and draw a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year and 7-year overall survival model. The area under the curve of the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year total survival prediction models was 0. 701, 0. 784 and 0. 772, respectively. The calibration curve plotted was close to the ideal 45° reference line, demonstrating the good predictive performance of the nomogram. Conclusion The constructed column chart and overall survival prediction model have good predictive value in the survival and prognosis of NSCLC patients in Xinjiang, helping to evaluate patient survival and provide important references for clinical treatment plans, and extending patient survival.","['Zhao, X.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Wang, X.', 'Jia, H.']",10.16073/j.cnki.cjcpt.2023.21.05
"What health inequalities exist in access to, outcomes from and experience of treatment for lung cancer? A scoping review","Objectives Lung cancer (LC) continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and while there have been significant improvements in overall survival, this gain is not equally distributed. To address health inequalities (HIs), it is vital to identify whether and where they exist. This paper reviews existing literature on what HIs impact LC care and where these manifest on the care pathway. Design A systematic scoping review based on Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework. Data sources Multiple databases (EMBASE, HMIC, Medline, PsycINFO, PubMed) were used to retrieve articles. Eligibility criteria Search limits were set to retrieve articles published between January 2012 and April 2022. Papers examining LC along with domains of HI were included. Two authors screened papers and independently assessed full texts. Data extraction and synthesis HIs were categorised according to: (a) HI domains: Protected Characteristics (PC); Socioeconomic and Deprivation Factors (SDF); Geographical Region (GR); Vulnerable or Socially Excluded Groups (VSG); and (b) where on the LC pathway (access to, outcomes from, experience of care) inequalities manifest. Data were extracted by two authors and collated in a spreadsheet for structured analysis and interpretation. Results 41 papers were included. The most studied domain was PC (32/41), followed by SDF (19/41), GR (18/41) and VSG (13/41). Most studies investigated differences in access (31/41) or outcomes (27/41), with few (4/41) exploring experience inequalities. Evidence showed race, rural residence and being part of a VSG impacted the access to LC diagnosis, treatment and supportive care. Additionally, rural residence, older age or male sex negatively impacted survival and mortality. The relationship between outcomes and other factors (eg, race, deprivation) showed mixed results. Conclusions Findings offer an opportunity to reflect on the understanding of HIs in LC care and provide a platform to consider targeted efforts to improve equity of access, outcomes and experience for patients.","['Lennox, L.', 'Lambe, K.', 'Hindocha, C.N.', 'Coronini-Cronberg, S.']",10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077610
Update on Lung Cancer Screening Guideline,"Lung cancer screening has been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality and is recommended for individuals meeting age and smoking history criteria. Despite the expansion of lung cancer screening guidelines in 2021, racial/ethnic and sex disparities persist. High-risk racial minorities and women are more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer at younger ages and have lower smoking histories when compared with White and male counterparts, resulting in higher rates of ineligibility for screening. Risk prediction models, biomarkers, and deep learning may help refine the selection of individuals who would benefit from screening.","['Senthil, P.', 'Kuhan, S.', 'Potter, A.L.', 'Jeffrey Yang, C.-F.']",10.1016/j.thorsurg.2023.04.002
Improved lung cancer clinical outcomes in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases,"Purpose Concomitant autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) can add morbidity and complicate treatment decisions for patients with lung cancer. We evaluated the tumour characteristics at diagnosis and clinical outcomes in lung cancer patients with or without ARD. Methods This retrospective cohort study included 10 963 patients with lung cancer, treated at Johns Hopkins. Clinical data including tumour characteristics and outcomes were extracted from the cancer registry. Data on patients’ history of 20 ARD were extracted from the electronic medical record. Logistic regression was used to compare tumour characteristics between those with and without ARD; Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models were performed to compare survival outcomes. Results ARD was present in 3.6% of patients (n=454). The mean age at diagnosis was 69 (SD 10) and 68 (SD 12) in patients with and without ARD (p=0.02). Female sex and smoking history were significantly associated with a history of ARD (OR: 1.75, OR: 1.46, p<0.05). Patients with ARD were more likely to be diagnosed with stage 1 lung cancer (36.8% vs 26.9%, p<0.001) and with smaller tumour size (OR: 0.76, p=0.01), controlling for sex, race and histology. Notably, lung cancer patients with ARD had a significantly prolonged median overall survival (OS) (7.11 years vs 1.7 years, p<0.001), independent of stage. Conclusion Patients with ARD and lung cancer had better OS compared with their counterparts, independent of cancer stage and treatments and were less likely to have advanced stage lung cancer at diagnosis. Additional studies are needed to investigate the differential immunological anti-tumour immune activity and genomic variations in patients with and without ARD.","['Ghanem, P.', 'Murray, J.C.', 'Marrone, K.A.', 'Scott, S.C.', 'Feliciano, J.L.', 'Lam, V.K.', 'Hann, C.L.', 'Ettinger, D.S.', 'Levy, B.P.', 'Forde, P.M.', 'Shah, A.A.', 'Mecoli, C.', 'Brahmer, J.', 'Cappelli, L.C.']",10.1136/rmdopen-2023-003471
"Racial, ethnic and gender trends in lung cancer mortality rates in the United States-Mexico border and non-border areas","Background: Geographic patterns of lung cancer mortality rate differ in the region bordering Mexico in contrast to the US. This study compares lung cancer mortality between border and non-border counties by race/ethnicity and gender. Methods: This study utilized population-level death certificate data from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Public Internet Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research dataset between 1999 and 2020. Established algorithms were implemented to examine lung cancer deaths among US residents. We analyzed the age-adjusted data by year, race/ethnicity, gender, and geographic region. Joinpoint regression was used to determine mortality trends across time. Results: Lung cancer mortality rates were lower in border counties compared to non-border counties across time (p < 0.05). Hispanic lung cancer mortality rates were not different in border counties compared to non-border counties during the same period (p > 0.05). Lung cancer mortality among non-Hispanic White living in border counties was lower than non-Hispanic White residing in non-border counties (p < 0.01), and non-Hispanic Black living in border counties had lower lung cancer mortality than non-Hispanic Black in non-border counties in all but three years (p < 0.05). Both female and male mortality rates were lower in border counties compared to non-border counties (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Differences in lung cancer mortality between border counties and non-border counties reflect lower mortality in Hispanics overall and a decline for non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Black living in border counties experiencing lower lung cancer mortality rates than non-border counties. Further studies are needed to identify specific causes for lower mortality rates in border counties.","['Gutierrez, J.A.', 'Hirth, J.M.', 'Zoorob, R.', 'Levine, R.S.']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2023.107686
"The Philadelphia Lung Cancer Learning Community: A multi-health-system, citywide approach to lung cancer screening","Background: Lung cancer screening uptake for individuals at high risk is generally low across the United States, and reporting of lung cancer screening practices and outcomes is often limited to single hospitals or institutions. We describe a citywide, multicenter analysis of individuals receiving lung cancer screening integrated with geospatial analyses of neighborhood-level lung cancer risk factors. Methods: The Philadelphia Lung Cancer Learning Community consists of lung cancer screening clinicians and researchers at the 3 largest health systems in the city. This multidisciplinary, multi-institutional team identified a Philadelphia Lung Cancer Learning Community study cohort that included 11 222 Philadelphia residents who underwent low-dose computed tomography for lung cancer screening from 2014 to 2021 at a Philadelphia Lung Cancer Learning Community health-care system. Individual-level demographic and clinical data were obtained, and lung cancer screening participants were geocoded to their Philadelphia census tract of residence. Neighborhood characteristics were integrated with lung cancer screening counts to generate bivariate choropleth maps. Results: The combined sample included 37.8% Black adults, 52.4% women, and 56.3% adults who currently smoke. Of 376 residential census tracts in Philadelphia, 358 (95.2%) included 5 or more individuals undergoing lung cancer screening, and the highest counts were geographically clustered around each health system's screening sites. A relatively low percentage of screened adults resided in census tracts with high tobacco retailer density or high smoking prevalence. Conclusions: The sociodemographic characteristics of lung cancer screening participants in Philadelphia varied by health system and neighborhood. These results suggest that a multicenter approach to lung cancer screening can identify vulnerable areas for future tailored approaches to improving lung cancer screening uptake. Future directions should use these findings to develop and test collaborative strategies to increase lung cancer screening at the community and regional levels.","['Barta, J.A.', 'Erkmen, C.P.', 'Shusted, C.S.', 'Myers, R.E.', 'Saia, C.', 'Cohen, S.', 'Wainwright, J.', 'Zeigler-Johnson, C.', 'Dako, F.', 'Wender, R.', 'Kane, G.C.', 'Vachani, A.', 'Rendle, K.A.']",10.1093/jncics/pkad071
Trends in participant race and sex reporting in lung cancer phase III clinical trials,"Background: Clinical trials are an essential part of advancing care for cancer patients. Historically, however, racial minorities and females have been underrepresented in these trials. Efforts like the National Institute of Health Revitalization Act attempted to mitigate these disparities, but despite these efforts, they continue to exist. These disparities can subsequently lead to minorities and females receiving suboptimal care. Aims: The purpose of our study was to understand the changing trends in reporting of participant race and sex as a demographic variable in phase III lung cancer clinical trials published over the last 35 years given these consequences of poor representation. Methods and results: A total of 426 articles reporting the results of phase III lung cancer clinical trials published from 1984 to 2019 were identified in PubMed. From these articles, data on participant sex and race were collected from the demographic tables to construct the database for this study. This database was subsequently used to determine the rate of reporting of demographic factors like race and sex and the participation trends over the time of minority and female participation in lung cancer phase III clinical trials. The SciPy Stats package for Python was used to calculate descriptive statistics, 95% confidence intervals, two sample t-test, one-way analysis of variance test, and Pearson's correlation coefficients. The Matplotlib package for Python was used for figure generation. Only 137 (32.2%) of the 426 studies analyzed reported the race of participants. Among those studies, we found that the mean participation rate of White participants was significantly higher (82.65%; p <.001). We found a decrease in African American participants and an increase in Asian participants over time. When looking at sex, we found that although the rate of male participation (69.02%) was significantly higher than that of female participation (30.98%), female participation has improved with time at a rate of 0.65% per year. Conclusion: We found that the reporting and participation of minority races continue to lag that of other demographic factors like sex in phase III clinical trials in lung cancer. Based on our analysis, we note a decline in participation of African Americans in lung cancer phase III clinical trials despite the rising incidence of lung cancer.","['Aslam, F.N.', 'Manochakian, R.', 'Lou, Y.', 'Colon-Otero, G.', 'Sher, T.']",10.1002/cnr2.1856

Trends in Lung Cancer Incidence and Mortality (1990-2019) in the United States: A Comprehensive Analysis of Gender and State-Level Disparities,"PURPOSE: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. This study aims to analyze lung cancer incidence, mortality, and related statistics from 1990 to 2019, focusing on national- and state-level trends and exploring potential disparities between sexes. METHODS: The Global Burden of Disease database was used to extract tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer mortality data from 1990 to 2019 for both males and females and across all states of the United States. Age-standardized incidence rates, age-standardized mortality rates, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and mortality-to-incidence indices (MIIs) were studied to assess for gender-based, geographic, and temporal disparities. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to further evaluate trends. RESULTS: The incidence of these cancers in the United States decreased between 1990 and 2019 by 23.35%, with a more significant decline in males (37.73%) than females (1.41%). Similarly, for mortality, a decrease was observed for both sexes combined (26.83%), but much more significantly for males (40.23%) than females (6.01%). The MIIs decreased overall, but there were variations across states. DALYs decreased for both sexes combined, with males experiencing a larger reduction, but an increase was noted in some states for females. CONCLUSION: This analysis reveals diverse trends pertaining to the incidence, mortality, and disability burden associated with lung cancer by sex and states in the United States, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions to reduce disparities. These findings contribute to our understanding of the current landscape of lung cancer and can inform future strategies for prevention, early detection, and management.","['Jani, C.T.', 'Singh, H.', 'Abdallah, N.', 'Mouchati, C.', 'Arora, S.', 'Kareff, S.', 'Salciccioli, J.', 'Thomson, C.C.', 'Velcheti, V.']",10.1200/GO.23.00255
Lung Cancer Screening Decision Aid Designed for a Primary Care Setting: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: Guidelines recommend shared decision-making prior to initiating lung cancer screening (LCS). However, evidence is lacking on how to best implement shared decision-making in clinical practice. Objective: To evaluate the impact of an LCS Decision Tool (LCSDecTool) on the quality of decision-making and LCS uptake. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial enrolled participants at Veteran Affairs Medical Centers in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and West Haven, Connecticut, from March 18, 2019, to September 29, 2021, with follow-up through July 18, 2022. Individuals aged 55 to 80 years with a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years who were current smokers or had quit within the past 15 years were eligible to participate. Individuals with LCS within 15 months were excluded. Of 1047 individuals who were sent a recruitment letter or had referred themselves, 140 were enrolled. Intervention: A web-based patient- and clinician-facing LCS decision support tool vs an attention control intervention. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome was decisional conflict at 1 month. Secondary outcomes included decisional conflict immediately after intervention and 3 months after intervention, knowledge, decisional regret, and anxiety immediately after intervention and 1 and 3 months after intervention and LCS by 6 months. Results: Of 140 enrolled participants (median age, 64.0 [IQR, 61.0-69.0] years), 129 (92.1%) were men and 11 (7.9%) were women. Of 137 participants with data available, 75 (53.6%) were African American or Black and 62 (44.3%) were White; 4 participants (2.9%) also reported Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean decisional conflict score at 1 month did not differ between the LCSDecTool and control groups (25.7 [95% CI, 21.4-30.1] vs 29.9 [95% CI, 25.6-34.2], respectively; P =.18). Mean LCS knowledge score was greater in the LCSDecTool group immediately after intervention (7.0 [95% CI, 6.3-7.7] vs 4.9 [95% CI, 4.3-5.5]; P <.001) and remained higher at 1 month (6.3 [95% CI, 5.7-6.8] vs 5.2 [95% CI, 4.5-5.8]; P =.03) and 3 months (6.2 [95% CI, 5.6-6.8] vs 5.1 [95% CI, 4.4-5.8]; P =.01). Uptake of LCS was greater in the LCSDecTool group at 6 months (26 of 69 [37.7%] vs 15 of 71 [21.1%]; P =.04). Conclusions and Relevance: In this randomized clinical trial of an LCSDecTool compared with attention control, no effect on decisional conflict occurred at 1 month. The LCSDecTool used in the primary care setting did not yield a significant difference in decisional conflict. The intervention led to greater knowledge and LCS uptake. These findings can inform future implementation strategies and research in LCS shared decision-making.","['Schapira, M.M.', 'Hubbard, R.A.', 'Whittle, J.', 'Vachani, A.', 'Kaminstein, D.', 'Chhatre, S.', 'Rodriguez, K.L.', 'Bastian, L.A.', 'Kravetz, J.D.', 'Asan, O.', 'Prigge, J.M.', 'Meline, J.', 'Schrand, S.', 'Ibarra, J.V.', 'Dye, D.A.', 'Rieder, J.B.', 'Frempong, J.O.', 'Fraenkel, L.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.30452
Ethnicity-specific association between TERT rs2736100 (A > C) polymorphism and lung cancer risk: a comprehensive meta-analysis,"The rs2736100 (A > C) polymorphism of the second intron of Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has been confirmed to be closely associated with the risk of Lung cancer (LC), but there is still no unified conclusion on the results of its association with LC. This study included Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and case-control studies reported so far on this association between TERT rs2736100 polymorphism and LC to clarify such a correlation with LC and the differences in it between different ethnicities and different types of LC. Relevant literatures published before May 7, 2022 on 'TERT rs2736100 polymorphism and LC susceptibility' in PubMed, EMbase, CENTRAL, MEDLINE databases were searched through the Internet, and data were extracted. Statistical analysis of data was performed in Revman5.3 software, including drawing forest diagrams, drawing funnel diagrams and so on. Sensitivity and publication bias analysis were performed in Stata 12.0 software. The C allele of TERT rs2736100 was associated with the risk of LC (Overall population: [OR] = 1.21, 95%CI [1.17, 1.25]; Caucasians: [OR] = 1.11, 95%CI [1.06, 1.17]; Asians: [OR] = 1.26, 95%CI [1.21, 1.30]), and Asians had a higher risk of LC than Caucasians (C vs. A: Caucasians: [OR] = 1.11 /Asians: [OR]) = 1.26). The other gene models also showed similar results. The results of stratified analysis of LC patients showed that the C allele was associated with the risk of Non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), and the risk of NSCLC and LUAD in Asians was higher than that in Caucasians. The C allele was associated with the risk of Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) and Small cell lung carcinoma(SCLC) in Asians but not in Caucasians. NSCLC patients ([OR] = 1.27) had a stronger correlation than SCLC patients ([OR] = 1.03), and LUAD patients ([OR] = 1.32) had a stronger correlation than LUSC patients ([OR] = 1.09).In addition, the C allele of TERT rs2736100 was associated with the risk of LC, NSCLC and LUAD in both smoking groups and non-smoking groups, and the risk of LC in non-smokers of different ethnic groups was higher than that in smokers. In the Asians, non-smoking women were more at risk of developing LUAD. The C allele of TERT rs2736100 is a risk factor for LC, NSCLC, and LUAD in different ethnic groups, and the Asian population is at a more common risk. The C allele is a risk factor for LUSC and SCLC in Asians but not in Caucasians. And smoking is not the most critical factor that causes variation in TERT rs2736100 to increase the risk of most LC (NSCLC, LUAD). Therefore, LC is a multi-etiological disease caused by a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.","['Wu, X.', 'Huang, G.', 'Li, W.', 'Chen, Y.']",10.1038/s41598-023-40504-y
"Quality of life, anxiety, depression, and distress in patients with advanced and metastatic lung cancer","OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer (LC) patients have shown a predisposition for developing emotional and physical symptoms, with detrimental effects on the quality of life (QoL). This study evaluates the bidirectional relationship between main psychological disorders and clinical/sociodemographic factors with the QoL. METHODS: In this observational cross-sectional study, patients with a confirmed LC diagnosis from February 2015 to March 2018 were eligible for this study. Each participant completed screening instruments of anxiety, depression, distress, and QoL assessment. Other relevant clinical data were extracted from electronic health records. Then comparisons, correlations, and logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and four cases were eligible; of them, the median age was 61 (24-84) years, most had clinical stage IV (95%), and most were under first-line therapy (53%). Concerning psychological status, 46% had symptoms of emotional distress, 35% anxiety, and 31% depression. Patients with psychological disorders experienced a worse global QoL than those without psychological impairment (p < 0.001). Increased financial issues and physical symptoms, combined with lower functioning, were also significantly associated with anxiety, depression, and distress. In the multivariate analysis, female sex and emotional distress were positively associated with an increased risk of depression; likewise, female sex, low social functioning, insomnia, and emotional distress were associated with anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Emotional symptoms and QoL had a significant bidirectional effect on this study; this underscores the necessity to identify and treat anxiety, depression, and distress to improve psychological well-being and the QoL in LC patients.","['Gonzalez-Ling, A.', 'Galindo Vázquez, O.', 'Espinoza Bello, M.', 'Robles, R.', 'Rascón-Gasca, M.L.', 'Lara-Mejía, L.', 'Heredia, D.', 'Arrieta, O.']",10.1017/S147895152200116X
Factors Associated With Receipt of Molecular Testing and its Impact on Time to Initial Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Background: Despite recommendations for molecular testing irrespective of patient characteristics, differences exist in receipt of molecular testing for oncogenic drivers amongst metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) patients. Exploration into these differences and their effects on treatment is needed to identify opportunities for improvement. Patients and Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult patients diagnosed with mNSCLC between 2011 and 2018 using PCORnet's Rapid Cycle Research Project dataset (n = 3600). Log-binomial, Cox proportional hazards (PH), and time-varying Cox regression models were used to ascertain whether molecular testing was received, and time from diagnosis to molecular testing and/or initial systemic treatment in the context of patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, and multiple comorbidities status. Results: The majority of patients in this cohort were ≤ 65 years of age (median [25th, 75th]: 64 [57, 71]), male (54.3%), non-Hispanic white individuals (81.6%), with > 2 comorbidities in addition to mNSCLC (54.1%). About half the cohort received molecular testing (49.9%). Patients who received molecular testing had a 59% higher probability of initial systemic treatment than patients who were yet to receive testing. Multiple comorbidity status was positively associated with receipt of molecular testing (RR, 1.27; 95% CI 1.08, 1.49). Conclusion: Receipt of molecular testing in academic centers was associated with earlier initiation of systemic treatment. This finding underscores the need to increase molecular testing rates amongst mNSCLC patients during a clinically relevant period. Further studies to validate these findings in community centers are warranted.","['Osazuwa-Peters, O.L.', 'Wilson, L.E.', 'Check, D.K.', 'Roberts, M.C.', 'Srinivasan, S.', 'Clark, A.G.', 'Crawford, J.', 'Chrischilles, E.', 'Carnahan, R.M.', 'Campbell, W.S.', 'Cowell, L.G.', 'Greenlee, R.', 'Abbott, A.M.', 'Mosa, A.S.M.', 'Mandhadi, V.', 'Stoddard, A.', 'Dinan, M.A.']",10.1016/j.cllc.2023.03.001
Factors Associated With Nonadherence to Lung Cancer Screening Across Multiple Screening Time Points,"IMPORTANCE Screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in randomized clinical trials in which the rate of adherence to follow-up recommendations was over 90%; however, adherence to Lung Computed Tomography Screening Reporting & Data System (Lung-RADS) recommendations has been low in practice. Identifying patients who are at risk of being nonadherent to screening recommendations may enable personalized outreach to improve overall screening adherence. OBJECTIVE To identify factors associated with patient nonadherence to Lung-RADS recommendations across multiple screening time points. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cohort study was conducted at a single US academic medical center across 10 geographically distributed sites where lung cancer screening is offered. The study enrolled individuals who underwent low-dose CT screening for lung cancer between July 31, 2013, and November 30, 2021. EXPOSURES Low-dose CT screening for lung cancer. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was nonadherence to follow-up recommendations for lung cancer screening, defined as failing to complete a recommended or more invasive follow-up examination (ie, diagnostic dose CT, positron emission tomography-CT, or tissue sampling vs low-dose CT) within 15 months (Lung-RADS score, 1 or 2), 9 months (Lung-RADS score, 3), 5 months (Lung-RADS score, 4A), or 3 months (Lung-RADS score, 4B/X). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with patient nonadherence to baseline Lung-RADS recommendations. A generalized estimating equations model was used to assess whether the pattern of longitudinal Lung-RADS scores was associated with patient nonadherence over time. RESULTS Among 1979 included patients, 1111 (56.1%) were aged 65 years or older at baseline screening (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [6.6] years), and 1176 (59.4%) were male. The odds of being nonadherent were lower among patients with a baseline Lung-RADS score of 1 or 2 vs 3 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.35; 95% CI, 0.25-0.50), 4A (AOR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.13-0.33), or 4B/X, (AOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.05-0.19); with a postgraduate vs college degree (AOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53-0.92); with a family history of lung cancer vs no family history (AOR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.93); with a high age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score (≥4) vs a low score (0 or 1) (AOR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46-0.98); in the high vs low income category (AOR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65-0.98); and referred by physicians from pulmonary or thoracic-related departments vs another department (AOR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73). Among 830 eligible patients who had completed at least 2 screening examinations, the adjusted odds of being nonadherent to Lung-RADS recommendations at the following screening were increased in patients with consecutive Lung-RADS scores of 1 to 2 (AOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.12-1.69). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this retrospective cohort study, patients with consecutive negative lung cancer screening results were more likely to be nonadherent with follow-up recommendations. These individuals are potential candidates for tailored outreach to improve adherence to recommended annual lung cancer screening.","['Lin, Y.', 'Liang, L.-J.', 'Ding, R.', 'Prosper, A.E.', 'Aberle, D.R.', 'Hsu, W.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.15250
Goals and goal perceptions in patients with advanced stage lung cancer: a mixed methods study,"Purpose: Goals provide insight into what is important to an individual. We describe the development and application of a mixed methods approach to elicit goals and perceptions about goals in patients with advanced cancer. Methods: Patients receiving first-line treatment for advanced lung cancer participated in semi-structured interviews about their goals. Participants self-generated goals, then selected and ranked their three most important goals and provided Likert scale ratings of goal-related perceptions (e.g., attainability, locus of control). Independent raters coded goals into content domains. One month later, participants reported perceived progress toward goals and facilitators of and barriers to progress. Results: Participants (N = 75, M age = 64.5 years, 59% female) identified goals across eight domains: social/role/relationship, everyday/practical, leisure/pleasure, psychological/existential/spiritual, major life changes or achievements, cancer treatment response/disease outcomes, palliative outcomes, and behavioral health improvement. Of all goals identified (N = 352), 72% of patients had at least one social/role/relationship goal, 68% had a leisure/pleasure goal, and 29% had a cancer treatment response goal. On average, participants considered their goals to be attainable, perceived a high degree of control over reaching goals, anticipated making “some” progress in the short term, and perceived a high likelihood of reaching goals in the future. Facilitators of progress included mental fortitude, feeling physically well, and social support. Barriers included cancer-related side effects, practical challenges, and COVID-19. Conclusions: A majority of participant goals focused on meaningful engagement and living well. Goals were largely viewed as attainable and under participants’ control. Cancer clinicians may consider how to support patients in working toward valued goals in conjunction with oncology care.","['Hyland, K.A.', 'Oswald, L.B.', 'Reblin, M.', 'Small, B.J.', 'Gray, J.E.', 'Jim, H.S.L.', 'Jacobsen, P.B.']",10.1007/s00520-023-07745-z
Disparities in lung cancer,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States. Despite a substantial decline in lung cancer incidence and mortality across all races in the last few decades, medically underserved racial and ethnic minority populations continue to carry the greatest burden of disease throughout the lung cancer continuum. Black individuals experience a higher incidence of lung cancer due to lower rates of low-dose computed tomography screening, which translate into advanced disease stage at diagnosis and poorer survival outcomes compared with White individuals. With respect to treatment, Black patients are less likely to receive gold standard surgery, have access to biomarker testing or high-quality treatment compared with White patients. The reasons for those disparities are multifactorial and include socioeconomic (eg, poverty, lack of health insurance, and inadequate education), and geographic inequalities. The objective of this article is to review the sources of racial and ethnic disparities in lung cancer, and to propose recommendations to help address them.","['Duma, N.', 'Evans, N.', 'Mitchell, E.']",10.1016/j.jnma.2023.02.004
Comparison of the sensitivity of different criteria to select lung cancer patients for screening in a cohort of German patients,"Introduction: Trials of CT-based screening for lung cancer have shown a mortality advantage for screening in North America and Europe. Before introducing a nationwide lung cancer screening program in Germany, it is important to assess the criteria used in international trials in the German population. Methods: We used data from 3623 lung cancer patients from the data warehouse of the German Center for Lung Research (DZL). We compared the sensitivity of the following lung cancer screening criteria overall and stratified by age and histology: the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST), the 2013 and 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and an adapted version of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian no race model (adapted PLCOm2012) with 6-year risk thresholds of 1.0%/6 year and 1.7%/6 year. Results: Overall, the adapted PLCOm2012 model (1%/6 years), selected the highest proportion of lung cancer patients for screening (72.4%), followed by the 2021 USPSTF (70.0%), the adapted PLCOm2012 (1.7%/6 year) (57.4%), the 2013 USPTF (57.0%), DLCST criteria (48.7%), and the NLST (48.5%). The adapted PLCOm2012 risk model (1.0%/6 year) had the highest sensitivity for all histological types except for small-cell and large-cell carcinomas (non-significant), whereas the 2021 USPTF selected a higher proportion of patients. The sensitivity levels were higher in males than in females. Conclusion: Using a risk-based selection score resulted in higher sensitivities compared to criteria using dichotomized age and smoking history. However, gender disparities were apparent in all studied eligibility criteria. In light of increasing lung cancer incidences in women, all selection criteria should be reviewed for ways to close this gender gap, especially when implementing a large-scale lung cancer screening program.","['Walter, J.', 'Kauffmann-Guerrero, D.', 'Muley, T.', 'Reck, M.', 'Fuge, J.', 'Günther, A.', 'Majeed, R.W.', 'Savai, R.', 'Koch, I.', 'Dinkel, J.', 'Schneider, C.', 'Senghas, K.', 'Kobinger, S.', 'Manapov, F.', 'Thomas, M.', 'Kahnert, K.', 'Winter, H.', 'Behr, J.', 'Tammemägi, M.', 'Tufman, A.']",10.1002/cam4.5638
Investigation of EGFR and ALK mutation frequency and treatment results in advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"Aim: Lung cancer has opened a new era in cancer treatment by elucidating the tumor's molecular structure and identifying the targetable mutations. Identifying the targeted mutations in lung cancer constitutes one of the main steps of treatment planning. The frequency of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor gene) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene) mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) also varies in populations depending on ethnicity, gender, smoking, and histopathological subtype. In general, limited data are available regarding the frequency and regional distribution of these mutations in the Turkish population. Our study aimed to determine the frequency of EGFR and ALK mutations in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC and compare the clinical characteristics, treatment, and survival results of cases with mutations with the group without mutations. Materials and Methods: In our study, 593 patients with advanced-stage NSCLC diagnosis and mutational analyses were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic characteristics, tumor stages (tumor, node, metastasis, TNM), EGFR and ALK analysis results, treatments applied, and survival of the cases were recorded. EGFR analysis, exon 18, 19, 20, and 21 mutations were studied with real-time PCR (RT-PCR) Rotor-Gene system from patients' samples. For ALK analysis, the ALK Break Apart kit (Zytovision GmbH; Germany) was used with the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method. Results: In our study, EGFR mutation was detected in 63 patients (10.6%) and ALK mutation in 19 patients (3.2%) out of 593 patients. EGFR mutation was observed more frequently in women and non-smokers (P = 0.001, P = 0.003). No correlation was found between the presence of EGFR mutation and metastases regions and recurrence (P > 0.05). ALK mutation was observed more frequently in non-smokers and females (P = 0.001, P = 0.003). Patients with ALK mutations were younger than other groups (P = 0.003). There was also no significant relationship between ALK mutation and metastates regions and recurrence after treatment (P > 0.05). Patients with EGFR or ALK mutations had a longer life span than other cases (P = 0.474). Those who had ALK mutations and received targeted therapy had a longer average life expectancy (P < 0.05). No difference was observed in those who had EGFR mutations and received targeted treatment in terms of survival (P > 0.05). Conclusion: In our study, conducted in the Aegean region of Turkey, the positivity rates of EGFR and ALK mutations were found to be at similar rates with the Caucasian race across the world. EGFR mutation was more common in women, non-smokers, and patients with adenocarcinoma histology. ALK mutation was also detected more frequently in younger patients, women, and non-smokers. Patients with EGFR and ALK mutations had a longer life expectancy than those without the mutation. It was observed that testing patients diagnosed with advanced-stage NSCLC for genetic mutations of the tumor in the first step of the treatment and initiating treatment in patients with mutations provided a significant survival advantage.","['Komurcuoglu, B.', 'Karakurt, G.', 'Kaya, O.', 'Diniz, G.', 'Kirbiyik, O.', 'Evkan, A.', 'Yalniz, E.']",10.4103/jcrt.JCRT_1766_20
Development and validation of nomograms to predict early death in non-small cell lung cancer patients with brain metastasis: a retrospective study in the SEER database,"Background: Throughout the course of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a lot of patients would develop brain metastasis (BM) associated with the poor prognosis and high rate of mortality. However, there have been few models to predict early death (ED) from NSCLC patients with BM. We aimed to develop nomograms to predict ED in NSCLC patients with BM. Methods: The NSCLC patients with BM between 2010 and 2015 were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) database. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: (I) patients were pathologically diagnosed as NSCLC; (II) patients who suffered from BM. The patients were randomly divided into 2 cohorts at the ratio of 7:3, for training and validation cohorts, respectively. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were managed to identify risk factors for ED in NSCLC patients with BM. Two nomograms were established and validated by calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The follow-up data included survival months, causes of death, vital status. Death that occurred within 3 months of initial diagnosis is defined as ED and the endpoints were all-cause ED and cancer-specific ED. Results: A total of 4,920 NSCLC patients with BM were included and randomly divided into 2 cohorts (7:3), including the training (n=3,444) and validation (n=1,476) cohorts. The independent prognostic factors for all-cause ED and cancer-specific ED included age, sex, race, tumor size, histology, T stage, N stage, grade, surgical operation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, bone metastasis, and liver metastasis. All these variables were used to establish the nomograms. In the nomograms of all-cause and cancer-specific ED, the areas under the ROC curves were 0.813 (95% CI: 0.799-0.837) and 0.808 (95% CI: 0.791-0.830) for the training dataset as well as 0.835 (95% CI: 0.805-0.862) and 0.824 (95% CI: 0.790-0.849) for the validation dataset, respectively. Besides, the calibration curves proved that the predicted ED was consistent with the actual value. DCA suggested a good clinical application. Conclusions: The nomograms can be used to predict the specific probability of a patient's death, which aids in treatment decisions and focused care, as well as in physician-patient communication.","['Yang, F.', 'Gao, L.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Gao, W.']",10.21037/tcr-22-2323
Cancer Survival and Travel Time to Nearest Reference Care Center for 10 Cancer Sites: An Analysis of 21 French Cancer Registries,"Background: The impact of several non-clinical factors on cancer survival is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of travel time to the nearest referral center on survival of patients with cancer. Patients and methods: The study used data from the French Network of Cancer Registries that combines all the French population-based cancer registries. For this study, we included the 10 most common solid invasive cancer sites in France between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2015, representing 160,634 cases. Net survival was measured and estimated using flexible parametric survival models. Flexible excess mortality modelling was performed to investigate the association between travel time to the nearest referral center and patient survival. To allow the most flexible effects, restricted cubic splines were used to investigate the influence of travel times to the nearest cancer center on excess hazard ratio. Results: Among the 1-year and 5-year net survival results, lower survival was observed for patients residing farthest from the referral center for half of the included cancer types. The remoteness gap in survival was estimated to be up to 10% at 5 years for skin melanoma in men and 7% for lung cancer in women. The pattern of the effect of travel time was highly different according to tumor type, being either linear, reverse U-shape, non-significant, or better for more remote patients. For some sites restricted cubic splines of the effect of travel time on excess mortality were observed with a higher excess risk ratio as travel time increased. Conclusions: For numerous cancer sites, our results reveal geographical inequalities, with remote patients experiencing a worse prognosis, aside from the notable exception of prostate cancer. Future studies should evaluate the remoteness gap in more detail with more explanatory factors.","['Gardy, J.', 'Wilson, S.', 'Guizard, A.-V.', 'Bouvier, V.', 'Tron, L.', 'Launay, L.', 'Alves, A.', 'Launoy, G.', 'Molinié, F.', 'Bryère, J.', 'Dejardin, O.']",10.3390/cancers15051516
Timeliness of Lung Cancer Care From the Point of Suspicious Image at an Urban Safety Net Hospital,"Background: Timeliness of care is an important metric for lung cancer patients, and care delays in the safety-net setting have been described. Timeliness from the point of the suspicious image is not well-studied. Herein, we evaluate time intervals in the workup of lung cancer at an urban, safety net hospital and assess for disparities by demographic and clinical factors. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of lung cancer patients receiving some portion of their care at Boston Medical Center between 2015 and 2020. A total of 687 patients were included in the final analysis. Median times from suspicious image to first treatment (SIT), suspicious image to diagnosis (SID), and diagnosis to treatment (DT) were calculated. Nonparametric tests were applied to assess for intergroup differences in time intervals. Results: SIT, SID, and DT for the entire cohort was 78, 34, and 32 days, respectively. SIT intervals were 87 days for females and 72 days for males (p < .01). SIT intervals were 106, 110, 81, and 41 days for stages I, II, III, and IV, respectively (p < .01). SID intervals differed between black (40.5) and Hispanic (45) patients compared to white (28) and Asian (23) patients (p < .05). Conclusion: Advanced stage at presentation and male gender were associated with more timely treatment from the point of suspicious imaging while white and Asian were associated with more timely lung cancer diagnosis. Future analyses should seek to elucidate drivers of timeliness differences and assess for the impact of timeliness disparities on patient outcomes in the safety net setting.","['Siddiqi, N.', 'Pan, G.', 'Liu, A.', 'Lin, Y.', 'Jenkins, K.', 'Zhao, J.', 'Mak, K.', 'Tapan, U.', 'Suzuki, K.']",10.1016/j.cllc.2022.12.007
The determinants of health-related quality of life among patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer in Taiwan: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Although considered one of the most important prognostic factors for lung cancer patients, the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of the newly diagnosed lung cancer population remains scarcely focused on in the literature. Therefore, we aimed to identify the determinants of HRQOL among newly diagnosed lung cancer patients in Taiwan. Methods: Two hundred and fifty patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer were recruited from a medical center in northern Taiwan through convenience sampling. Four structured questionnaires, including the Taiwanese version of the MD Anderson symptom inventory (MDASI-T), the Taiwanese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-T), the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ-SF), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), were used to collect data. Further, a multivariate stepwise linear regression was conducted to determine the independent risk factors for HRQOL. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The patients (mean age was 61.04 years, 51.2% male, 94.0% non-small-cell lung cancer, 56.4% stage IIIB-IV) had moderate levels of HRQOL among the physical, psychological, social, and environmental domains, as well as overall QOL. HRQOL was not correlated with married status, religion, and comorbidity. Gender, age, family income, smoking status, cancer stage, ECOG PS scores, PA, symptom burden (severity and interference), and PSQI global scores were correlated with HRQOL. Notably, symptom severity was the dominant negative predictor affecting the psychological and environmental domains of QOL (β = -4.313 and -3.500, respectively), accounting for 23.2% and 14.6% of the variance, respectively. On the other hand, symptom interference was the dominant negative predictor affecting the physical and social domains of QOL, as well as overall QOL (β = -3.592, -1.984, and -0.150, respectively), accounting for 44.4%, 15.0%, and 24.1% of the variance, respectively. Conclusion: Newly diagnosed lung cancer patients suffered symptom severity and interference that significantly impaired their HRQOL; particularly, symptom interference affected the physical domain of QOL. Healthcare professionals should pay more attention to cancer-related symptom severity, symptom interference, and HRQOL changes when caring for newly diagnosed lung cancer patients.","['Liao, C.-H.', 'Yu, S.', 'Lin, K.-C.', 'Wu, Y.-C.', 'Wang, T.-J.', 'Wang, K.-Y.']",10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000858
Social disparities in pain management provision in stage IV lung cancer: A national registry analysis,"A strong association exists between pain and lung cancer (LC). Focusing on the disparities in pain referral in LC patients, we are aiming to characterize the prevalence and patterns of referrals to pain management (PM) in Stage IV non-small-cell LC (NSLC) and small-cell LC (SCLC). We sampled the National Cancer Database for de novo stage IV LC (2004-2016). We analyzed trends of pain referral using the Cochran-Armitage test. Chi-squared statistics were used to identify the sociodemographic and clinico-pathologic determinants of referral to PM, and significant variables (P < .05) were included in one multivariable regression model predicting the likelihood of pain referral. A total N = 17,620 (3.1%) of NSLC and N = 4305 (2.9%) SCLC patients were referred to PM. A significant increase in referrals was observed between 2004 and 2016 (NSLC: 1.7%-4.1%, P < .001; SCLC: 1.6%-4.2%, P < .001). Patient and disease factors played a significant role in likelihood of referral in both groups. Demographic factors such as gender, age, and facility type played a role in the likelihood of pain referrals, highlighting the gap and need for multidisciplinary PM in patients with LC. Despite an increase in the proportion of referrals to PM issued for terminal stage LC, the overall proportion remains low. To ensure better of quality of life for patients, oncologists need to be made aware of existent disparities and implicit biases.","['Yaghi, M.', 'Beydoun, N.', 'Mowery, K.', 'Abadir, S.', 'Bou Zerdan, M.', 'Jabbal, I.S.', 'Rivera, C.', 'Liang, H.', 'Alley, E.', 'Saravia, D.', 'Arteta-Bulos, R.']",10.1097/MD.0000000000032888
Genetic differences between smokers and never-smokers with lung cancer,"Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, therefore lung cancer epidemiological trends reflect the past trends of cigarette smoking to a great extent. The geographic patterns in mortality closely follow those in incidence. Although lung cancer is strongly associated with cigarette smoking, only about 15% of smokers get lung cancer, and also some never-smokers develop this malignancy. Although less frequent, lung cancer in never smokers is the seventh leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes worldwide. Lung cancer in smokers and never-smokers differs in many aspects: in histological types, environmental factors representing a risk, and in genes associated with this disease. In this review, we will focus on the genetic differences between lung cancer in smokers versus never-smokers: gene expression, germ-line polymorphisms, gene mutations, as well as ethnic and gender differences. Finally, treatment options for smokers and never-smokers will be briefly reviewed.","['Kuśnierczyk, P.']",10.3389/fimmu.2023.1063716
Potential Impact of Criteria Modifications on Race and Sex Disparities in Eligibility for Lung Cancer Screening,"Introduction: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening reduces lung cancer mortality, but current eligibility criteria underestimate risk in women and racial minorities. We evaluated the impact of screening criteria modifications on LDCT eligibility and lung cancer detection. Methods: Using data from a Lung Nodule Program, we compared persons eligible for LDCT by the following: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2013 criteria (55–80 y, ≥30 pack-years of smoking, and ≤15 y since cessation); USPSTF2021 criteria (50–80 y, ≥20 pack-years of smoking, and ≤15 y since cessation); quit duration expanded to less than or equal to 25 years (USPSTF2021-QD25); reducing the pack-years of smoking to more than or equal to 10 years (USPSTF2021-PY10); and both (USPSTF2021-QD25-PY10). We compare across groups using the chi-square test or analysis of variance. Results: The 17,421 individuals analyzed were of 56% female sex, 69% white, 28% black; 13% met USPSTF2013 criteria; 17% USPSTF2021; 18% USPSTF2021-QD25; 19% USPSTF2021-PY10; and 21% USPSTF2021-QD25-PY10. Additional eligible individuals by USPSTF2021 (n = 682) and USPSTF2021-QD25-PY10 (n = 1402) were 27% and 29% black, both significantly higher than USPSTF2013 (17%, p < 0.0001). These additional eligible individuals were 55% (USPSTF2021) and 55% (USPSTF2021-QD25-PY10) of female sex, compared with 48% by USPSTF2013 (p < 0.05). Of 1243 persons (7.1%) with lung cancer, 22% were screening eligible by USPSTF13. USPSTF2021-QD25-PY10 increased the total number of persons with lung cancer by 37%. These additional individuals with lung cancer were of 57% female sex (versus 48% with USPSTF2013, p = 0.0476) and 24% black (versus 20% with USPSTF2013, p = 0.3367). Conclusions: Expansion of LDCT screening eligibility criteria to allow longer quit duration and fewer pack-years of exposure enriches the screening-eligible population for women and black persons.","['Smeltzer, M.P.', 'Liao, W.', 'Faris, N.R.', 'Fehnel, C.', 'Goss, J.', 'Shepherd, C.J.', 'Ramos, R.', 'Qureshi, T.', 'Mukhopadhyay, A.', 'Ray, M.A.', 'Osarogiagbon, R.U.']",10.1016/j.jtho.2022.09.220
"Uptake of invitations to a lung health check offering low-dose CT lung cancer screening among an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse population at risk of lung cancer in the UK (SUMMIT): a prospective, longitudinal cohort study","Background: Lung cancer screening with low-dose CT reduces lung cancer mortality, but screening requires equitable uptake from candidates at high risk of lung cancer across ethnic and socioeconomic groups that are under-represented in clinical studies. We aimed to assess the uptake of invitations to a lung health check offering low-dose CT lung cancer screening in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse cohort at high risk of lung cancer. Methods: In this multicentre, prospective, longitudinal cohort study (SUMMIT), individuals aged 55–77 years with a history of smoking in the past 20 years were identified via National Health Service England primary care records at practices in northeast and north-central London, UK, using electronic searches. Eligible individuals were invited by letter to a lung health check offering lung cancer screening at one of four hospital sites, with non-responders re-invited after 4 months. Individuals were excluded if they had dementia or metastatic cancer, were receiving palliative care or were housebound, or declined research participation. The proportion of individuals invited who responded to the lung health check invitation by telephone was used to measure uptake. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses to estimate associations between uptake of a lung health check invitation and re-invitation of non-responders, adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, smoking, and deprivation score. This study was registered prospectively with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03934866. Findings: Between March 20 and Dec 12, 2019, the records of 2 333 488 individuals from 251 primary care practices across northeast and north-central London were screened for eligibility; 1 974 919 (84·6%) individuals were outside the eligible age range, 7578 (2·1%) had pre-existing medical conditions, and 11 962 (3·3%) had opted out of particpation in research and thus were not invited. 95 297 individuals were eligible for invitation, of whom 29 545 (31·0%) responded. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, re-invitation letters were sent to only a subsample of 4594 non-responders, of whom 642 (14·0%) responded. Overall, uptake was lower among men than among women (odds ratio [OR] 0·91 [95% CI 0·88–0·94]; p<0·0001), and higher among older age groups (1·48 [1·42–1·54] among those aged 65–69 years vs those aged 55–59 years; p<0·0001), groups with less deprivation (1·89 [1·76–2·04] for the most vs the least deprived areas; p<0·0001), individuals of Asian ethnicity (1·14 [1·09–1·20] vs White ethnicity; p<0·0001), and individuals who were former smokers (1·89 [1·83–1·95] vs current smokers; p<0·0001). When ethnicity was subdivided into 16 groups, uptake was lower among individuals of other White ethnicity than among those with White British ethnicity (0·86 [0·83–0·90]), whereas uptake was higher among Chinese, Indian, and other Asian ethnicities than among those with White British ethnicity (1·33 [1·13–1·56] for Chinese ethnicity; 1·29 [1·19–1·40] for Indian ethnicity; and 1·19 [1·08–1·31] for other Asian ethnicity). Interpretation: Inviting eligible adults for lung health checks in areas of socioeconomic and ethnic diversity should achieve favourable participation in lung cancer screening overall, but inequalities by smoking, deprivation, and ethnicity persist. Reminder and re-invitation strategies should be used to increase uptake and the equity of response.

Dyspnea in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer: a population-based analysis of disease burden and patterns of care,"Background: Patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) experience significant morbidity with dyspnea being a common symptom with a prevalence of 70%. The objective of this study was to determine factors associated with a moderate-to-severe dyspnea score based on the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), as well as resultant patterns of intervention and factors correlated to intervention receipt. Methods: Using health services administrative data, we conducted a population-based study of all patients diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC treated from January 2007 to September 2018 in the province of Ontario. The primary outcomes of interest are the prevalence of moderate-to-severe dyspnea scores, and the receipt of dyspnea-directed intervention. Differences in baseline characteristic between moderate-to-severe dyspnea and low dyspnea score cohorts were assessed by comparative statistics. Predictors of intervention receipt for patients with moderate-to-severe dyspnea scores were estimated using multivariable modified Poisson regression. Results: The initial study cohort included 13,159 patients diagnosed with metastatic NSCLC and of these, 9,434 (71.7%) reported a moderate-to-severe dyspnea score. Compared to patients who did not report moderate-to-severe dyspnea scores, those who reported a moderate-to-severe dyspnea score were more likely to complete a greater number of ESAS surveys, be male, have a higher Elixhauser comorbidity index (ECI) score, and receive subsequent systemic therapy after diagnosis. Most patients with a moderate-to-severe dyspnea score received intervention (96%), of which the most common were palliative care management (87%), thoracic radiotherapy (56%) and thoracentesis (37%). Multivariable regression identified older patients to be less likely to undergo pleurodesis. Thoracentesis was less common for patients living in rural and non-major urban areas, lower income areas, and earlier year of diagnosis. Receipt of thoracic radiotherapy was less common for older patients, females, those with ECI ≥4, patients living in major urban areas, and those with later year of diagnosis. Finally, palliative care referrals were less frequent for patients with ECI ≥4, age 60–69, residence outside of major urban areas, earlier year of diagnosis, and lower income areas. Conclusions: Dyspnea is a prevalent symptom amongst patients with metastatic NSCLC. Subpopulations of patients with moderate-to-severe dyspnea scores were in which inequities may exist in access to care that require further attention and evaluation.","['Yan, M.', 'Tjong, M.', 'Chan, W.C.', 'Darling, G.', 'Delibasic, V.', 'Davis, L.E.', 'Doherty, M.', 'Hallet, J.', 'Kidane, B.', 'Mahar, A.', 'Mittmann, N.', 'Parmar, A.', 'Tan, V.', 'Tan, H.', 'Wright, F.C.', 'Coburn, N.G.', 'Louie, A.V.']",10.21037/jtd-22-919
Relationship between ethnicity and stage at diagnosis in England: A national analysis of six cancer sites,"Objectives Cancer stage at diagnosis is a determinant of treatment options and survival. Previous research has shown differences in barriers to presentation with cancer between ethnic groups. The completeness and quality of cancer stage and ethnicity data has improved markedly over recent years in England, allowing for comparison of stage distributions at diagnosis between ethnic groups. This study aimed to assess relationships between ethnic group and two outcomes: unknown stage cancer and late stage (stages 3 and 4) cancer, after adjustment for confounders. Design and setting A retrospective secondary data analysis using data from NHS Digital's National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service and Hospital Episode Statistics records from 2012 to 2016. Participants This study analysed newly diagnosed breast, colon, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovary, prostate and uterine cancers in white British, Caribbean, African, Chinese and Asian patients aged 15-99 in England. Results Caribbean, African and Asian women with breast or ovarian cancer, Caribbean and African women with uterine or colon cancer, Caribbean women with NSCLC and Caribbean men with colon cancer had increased odds of late-stage disease at diagnosis compared with the white British cohort. In contrast, Caribbean and African men with prostate cancer had decreased odds of late-stage cancer. Where stage was known, there were variations in late-stage cancer by ethnic group. Conclusions Low symptom awareness and barriers to presentation can cause delays, resulting in later stage diagnosis. Targeted intervention campaigns to help raise awareness of cancer signs and symptoms and the benefits of early diagnosis, along with removing barriers to appropriate referrals, could help to improve these inequalities.","['Fry, A.', 'White, B.', 'Nagarwalla, D.', 'Shelton, J.', 'Jack, R.H.']",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062079
Disparate Time-to-Treatment and Varied Incidence of Actionable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Molecular Alterations in British Columbia: A Historical Cohort Study,"Background: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) outcomes remain suboptimal for early-stage disease despite emerging advances in systemic therapy for the peri-operative period. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) identifies driver mutations for which targeted therapies have been developed that improve survival. The BC lung cancer screening program, which was initiated in May 2022, is expected to identify people with early and late stages of NSCLC. It is crucial to first understand the molecular epidemiology and patterns of time to initiate treatment across its five health authorities (HA) to optimize the delivery of care for NSCLC in BC. In this way, we may harness the benefits of targeted therapy for more people with NSCLC as novel advances in therapy continue to emerge. Objective: to compare (a) the frequency of actionable NSCLC molecular alterations among HAs and (b) the time to treatment initiation. Methods: a retrospective observational study was conducted with prospectively collected data from the BC CGL Database. Adults with late stage NSCLC who underwent targeted NGS were included for the time period from May 2020 to June 2021. Demographics, actionable molecular alterations, PDL-1 expression, and time to treatment across HAs were examined. Using appropriate statistical tests for comparison among HAs, p>0.05 was deemed significant. Results: 582 patients underwent NGS/IHC and analysis during the study period. The mean age was 71 (10.1), and 326 (56%) patients were female. A significantly higher proportion of all EGFRm+ were identified within Vancouver Coastal Health (VCHA) and Fraser Health Authority (FHA) compared to the other health authorities (p < 0.001). This also holds true for common sensitizing EGFRm+ alone (p < 0.001) and for sensitizing EGFRm+ when adjusted for females and smoker status (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62, 0.92; p = 0.005). Patients residing within the Northern, Interior, and Island HAs were less likely to receive treatment at the same rate as those in VCHA and FHA HAs. Conclusion: actionable NSCLC driver mutations are present in all regional HAs, with disparity noted in time to initiate treatment between HAs. This provides evidence for the importance of molecular testing for patients in all BC HAs to guide personalized and timely NSCLC treatment.","['Hilzenrat, R.A.', 'Yip, S.', 'Melosky, B.', 'Ho, C.', 'Laskin, J.', 'Sun, S.', 'Choi, J.J.', 'McGuire, A.L.']",10.3390/curroncol30010012
Feasibility of Single - Encounter Telemedicine Lung Cancer Screening: A Retrospective Cohort Study in an Underserved Population,"Background: COVID-19 forced a delay of non-essential health services, including lung cancer screening. Our institution developed a single-encounter, telemedicine (SET) lung cancer screening whereby patients receive low-dose CT in-person, but counseling regarding results, coordination of follow-up care and smoking cessation is delivered using telemedicine. This study compares outcomes of SET lung cancer screening to our pre-COVID, single-visit, in-person (SIP) lung cancer screening. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed we recorded independent variables of gender, race/ethnicity, age, educational attainment, smoking status and dependent variables including cancer diagnosis, stage and treatment between March 2019 to July 2021. Using retrospective analysis, we compared outcomes of SIP lung cancer screening before COVID-19 and SET lung cancer screening amid COVID-19. Results: There was a significant difference in number of patients screened pre- and amid COVID-19.673 people were screened via SIP, while only 440 were screened via SET. SIP screening consisted of 52.5% Black/African American patients, which decreased to 37% with SET lung cancer screening. There was no significant difference in gender, age, or educational attainment. There was also no significant difference in Lung–RADS score between the 2 methods of screening or diagnostic procedures performed. Ultimately telemedicine based screening diagnosed fewer cancers, 1.6% diagnosed via telemedicine vs 3.3% screened by in person. Conclusion: We implemented SET lung cancer screening to continue lung cancer screening during a global pandemic. Our study established feasibility of telemedicine-based lung cancer screening among our predominantly African American/Black population, though fewer patients were screened. We found no difference in distribution between age, or educational attainment suggesting other factors discouraging lung cancer screening amid COVID-19.","['Magarinos, J.', 'Lutzow, L.', 'Dass, C.', 'Ma, G.X.', 'Erkmen, C.P.']",10.1177/10732748221121391
Ethnic differences in the characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer in the Te Manawa Taki region of New Zealand,"Background: Māori have three times the mortality from lung cancer compared with non-Māori. The Te Manawa Taki region has a population of 900 000, of whom 30% are Māori. We have little understanding of the factors associated with developing and diagnosing lung cancer and ethnic differences in these characteristics. Aims: To explore the differences in the incidence and characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer between Māori and non-Māori. Methods: Patients were identified from the regional register. Incidence rates were calculated based on population data from the 2013 and 2018 censuses. The patient and tumour characteristics of Māori and non-Māori were compared. The analysis used Χ2 tests and logistic models for categorical variables and Student t tests for continuous variables. Results: A total of 4933 patients were included, with 1575 Māori and 3358 non-Māori. The age-standardised incidence of Māori (236 per 100 000) was 3.3 times higher than that of non-Māori. Māori were 1.3 times more likely to have an advanced stage of disease and 1.97 times more likely to have small cell lung cancer. Māori were more likely to have comorbidities, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. They also had higher levels of social deprivation and tended to be younger, female and current smokers. Conclusions: The findings point to the need to address barriers to early diagnosis and the need for system change including the need to introduce a lung cancer screening focussing on Māori. There is also the need for preventive programmes to address comorbidities that impact lung cancer outcomes as well as a continued emphasis on creating a smoke-free New Zealand.","['Nguyen, H.', 'Lao, C.', 'Keenan, R.', 'Laking, G.', 'Elwood, M.', 'McKeage, M.', 'Wong, J.', 'Aitken, D.', 'Chepulis, L.', 'Lawrenson, R.']",10.1111/imj.16202
The journey of stage III and IV non-small cell lung cancer patients in the Brazilian private healthcare system: a retrospective study,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still diagnosed at late stages in Brazil.

The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients and time intervals of interest were described. A total of 10,394 patients were analyzed. The majority of the patients were male (58.5%) with a median age of 64.0 (IQR = 58.0 – 71.0) years. In relation to characteristics of the disease, most of the tumors were characterized as adenocarcinomas (52.3%) and diagnosed at stage IV (72.2%). Most patients arrived at the hospital with an established NSCLC diagnosis, while 45.7% were diagnosed at the first medical appointment in the hospital or later. For patients who were diagnosed at the first medical appointment or later, a median interval of 15.0 (IQR = 6.0 – 33.0) days was observed between the first medical appointment and the diagnosis. The first treatment was given after a median of 25.0 (IQR = 6.0 – 49.0) days after diagnosis for patients without a prior diagnosis, and 57.0 (IQR: 33.0 – 98.0) days for patients with a prior diagnosis. The most common treatments were chemotherapy alone (33.8%), chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (21.5%), radiotherapy alone (13.1%), adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment (9.3%), surgery (3.3%), and immunotherapy (0.7%; alone or combined). At the end of follow-up (September, 2020), 52.3% of the patients had died. Despite having more treatment options in the private sector, data show that there is a need to improve access to technologies.","['Cerqueira, E.R.', 'Batista, P.M.', 'Almeida, M.F.', 'Rego, M.A.C.', 'Ribeiro-Pereira, A.C.P.', 'Alencar, F.', 'Fernandes, R.A.', 'Calabrich, A.F.C.', 'Schvartsman, G.']",10.3389/fonc.2023.1257003
Post-Operative Poor Sleep Quality and Its Associated Factors Among Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Objective: The study aimed to determine the post-operative prevalence and factors associated to poor sleep quality in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in China. Methods: NSCLC patients (n=307) who underwent thoracoscopic surgery at the Department of Thoracic Surgery of Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital were enrolled in this study. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Prince Henry Hospital Pain Score and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV-1) were used to assess the factors that could lead to poor sleep quality. All assessments were carried out between April 1 and May 30, 2023. Descriptive analyses and stepwise factor regression were employed to determine the impact of various factors on sleep quality. The factors predictive of poor sleep quality were used to develop a predictive nomogram. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the predictive value of the nomogram. Results: The median PQSI score was 8 (interquartile range (IQR) 5–12), and 74.6% of patients had poor sleep quality. The median anxiety and depression scores were 6 (IQR 3–9) and 4 (IQR 2–7), respectively. The PSQI latency dimension had the highest score, while the use of sleep medications dimension had the lowest score. The multivariate analysis revealed that patients who were female (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.40–4.05; P <0.01), had post-secondary education (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19–0.92; P =0.03), tertiary education (OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.17–0.84; P =0.02), comorbidities (OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.51–4.39; P <0.01), a pain score 1 (OR, 4.22; 95% CI, 2.37–7.50; P <0.01), and cough (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.63–5.40; P <.001) were more like to experience poor sleep quality. The positive predictive value of the nomogram was 79.80% (p=0.390). Conclusion: Sociodemographic variables, comorbidities, and pain could be used to predict the post-operative sleep quality in NSCLC patients.","['Chen, X.', 'Hu, Y.', 'Fan, J.', 'Li, Y.']",10.2147/CMAR.S430436
Sex-specificity in Surgical Stages of Lung Cancer in Young Adults,"Background: Young Patients with lung cancer represent a distinct subset of patients with this neoplasm. Young International studies show increased lung cancer rates in females, while the incidence in males continues to decline. There is evidence to suggest that this trend recurs in younger patients. We studied the effects of gender differences on the incidence of surgical stages of lung cancer in young adults and its mortality rate. Methods: This study is a retrospective review (2010-2020) of young adults (aged under 45 years) with surgical-stage of lung cancer. We calculated female-to-male differences in incidence rate ratios, tumor characteristics, surgical management, and survival. Cumulative survival curves were generated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: We examined 46 men and 24 women, under 45 years. Female patients were diagnosed at earlier stages. The proportion of stage IA disease was significantly higher in women than in men (46% versus 13%, respectively) (p=0.03). Women were more likely never smokers (42% versus 83%, p=0.02). A histologic subtype, females were more likely to have typical carcinoid tumors (13.54% versus 10.21% for males) (p>0.05). The largest histological type in men was adenocarcinoma (25.53% versus 4.16%, p>0.05). All the patients were operated. Three men had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and one was operated on for cerebral oligometastatic before his chest surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given to 7 women and 21 men. Despite the small number of postoperative complications in our study (n= 8, 11.2%), the male sex was significant in predicting this complication (p<0.05). The mortality rate was 1.4%. The 5-year overall survival rates were 84% in men and 87% in women. Conclusion: Our study identified sex differences in the incidence and mortality rates for surgical lung cancers in young adults, but the biological and endocrine mechanisms implicated in these disparities have not yet been determined.","['Abdennadher, M.', 'Dahmane, M.H.', 'Zair, S.', 'Zribi, H.', 'Abdelkbir, A.', 'Bouassida, I.', 'Mlika, M.', 'Sahnoun, I.', 'Mansour, A.B.', 'Marghli, A.']",10.2174/18743064-v17-230818-2022-20
Health inequities across the lung cancer care continuum in ten marginalized populations: a narrative review,"Background and Objective: Lung cancer remains the deadliest cancer in the United States. Although lung cancer screening and innovative treatment options are available, accessing these interventions remains a barrier for marginalized communities due to social and structural challenges that influence health care access, which has led to worse outcomes when compared to Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) and non-marginalized populations. The objective of this study is to examine disparities in lung cancer and social/structural factors within ten critical populations (racial/ethnic minorities, low income, rural, LGBTQIA+, women, veteran and active duty, and small cell lung cancer) across the continuum of lung cancer care. Methods: Five databases (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and EBSCO Discovery Service) were queried from February 2022–June 2022. The inclusion criteria were (I) peer-reviewed academic journals published in English between the years 2000 and 2022; (II) research that focused on disparities across the lung cancer continuum; and (III) research articles addressing social and structural barriers to lung cancer health care access. A total of 95 articles and 24 reports were used for this narrative review. Key Content and Findings: Across the ten populations, consistent disparities were observed in lung cancer screening and treatment, exhibited by lower uptake in screening, treatment, clinical trials, and biomarker testing. Significant themes contributing to these disparities were socioeconomic status, transportation, language, historic trauma, provider bias or lack of cultural training, and lack of health care access, in part due to insurance coverage. Conclusions: Future studies are needed to further develop meaningful solutions to disparities in health outcomes and access for those who are at risk, diagnosed with, or surviving lung cancer from marginalized populations.","['Monestime, S.', 'Rigney, M.', 'Phipps, N.', 'Carlson, C.', 'Alongi, T.', 'Redding, M.', 'King, J.C.']",10.21037/jtd-23-727
Lung Cancer Screening in Brazil Comparing the 2013 and 2021 USPSTF Guidelines,"Importance: It is estimated that, from 2023 to 2025, lung cancer (LC) will be the second most frequent cancer in Brazil, but the country does not have an LC screening (LCS) policy. Objective: To compare the number of individuals eligible for screening, 5-year preventable LC deaths, and years of life gained (YLG) if LC death is averted by LCS, considering 3 eligibility strategies by sociodemographic characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness research study assessed 3 LCS criteria by applying a modified version of the LC-Death Risk Assessment Tool (LCDRAT) and the LC-Risk Assessment Tool (LCRAT). Data are from the 2019 Brazilian National Household Survey. Participants included ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years. Data analysis was performed from February to May 2023. Exposures: Exposures included ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years, US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2013 guidelines (ever-smokers aged 55 to 80 years with ≥30 pack-years and <15 years since cessation), and USPSTF 2021 guidelines (ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years with 20 pack-years and <15 years since cessation). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were the numbers of individuals eligible for LCS, the 5-year preventable deaths attributable to LC, and the number of YLGs if death due to LC was averted by LCS. Results: In Brazil, the eligible population for LCS was 27280920 ever-smokers aged 50 to 80 years (13387552 female [49.1%]; 13249531 [48.6%] aged 50-60 years; 394994 Asian or Indigenous [1.4%]; 3111676 Black [11.4%]; 10942640 Pardo [40.1%]; 12830904 White [47.0%]; 12428536 [45.6%] with an incomplete middle school education; and 12860132 [47.1%] living in the Southeast region); 5144322 individuals met the USPSTF 2013 criteria for LCS (2090636 female [40.6%]; 2290219 [44.5%] aged 61-70 years; 66430 Asian or Indigenous [1.3%]; 491527 Black [9.6%]; 2073836 Pardo [40.3%]; 2512529 [48.8%] White; 2436221 [47.4%] with an incomplete middle school education; and 2577300 [50.1%] living in the Southeast region), and 8380279 individuals met the USPSTF 2021 LCS criteria (3507760 female [41.9%]; 4352740 [51.9%] aged 50-60 years; 119925 Asian or Indigenous [1.4%]; 839171 Black [10.0%]; 3330497 Pardo [39.7%]; 4090687 [48.8%] White; 4022784 [48.0%] with an incomplete middle school education; and 4162070 [49.7%] living in the Southeast region). The number needed to screen to prevent 1 death was 177 individuals according to the USPSTF 2013 criteria and 242 individuals according to the USPSTF 2021 criteria. The YLG was 23 for all ever-smokers, 19 for the USPSTF 2013 criteria, and 21 for the USPSTF 2021 criteria. Being Black, having less than a high school education, and living in the North and Northeast regions were associated with increased 5-year risk of LC death. Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness study, USPSTF 2021 criteria were better than USPSTF 2013 in reducing disparities in LC death rates. Nonetheless, the risk of LC death remained unequal, and these results underscore the importance of identifying an appropriate approach for high-risk populations for LCS, considering the local epidemiological context.","['Emmerick, I.C.M.', 'Campos, M.R.', 'Castanheira, D.', 'Muzy, J.', 'Marques, A.', 'Arueira Chaves, L.', 'Sobreira Da Silva, M.J.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.46994
Epidemiological and demographic drivers of lung cancer mortality from 1990 to 2019: results from the global burden of disease study 2019,"Background: Understanding the effects of demographic drivers on lung cancer mortality trends is critical for lung cancer control. We have examined the drivers of lung cancer mortality at the global, regional, and national levels. Methods: Data on lung cancer death and mortality were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for lung cancer and all-cause mortality were calculated to measure temporal trends in lung cancer from 1990 to 2019. Decomposition analysis was used to analyze the contributions of epidemiological and demographic drivers to lung cancer mortality. Results: Despite a non-significant decrease in ASMR [EAPC = -0.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.1 to 0.49], the number of deaths from lung cancer increased by 91.8% [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 74.5-109.0%] between 1990 and 2019. This increase was due to the changes in the number of deaths attributable to population aging (59.6%), population growth (56.7%), and non-GBD risks (3.49%) compared with 1990 data. Conversely, the number of lung cancer deaths due to GBD risks decreased by 19.8%, mainly due to tobacco (-12.66%), occupational risks (-3.52%), and air pollution (-3.47%). More lung cancer deaths (1.83%) were observed in most regions, which were due to high fasting plasma glucose levels. The temporal trend of lung cancer ASMR and the patterns of demographic drivers varied by region and gender. Significant associations were observed between the contributions of population growth, GBD risks and non-GBD risks (negative), population aging (positive), and ASMR in 1990, the sociodemographic index (SDI), and the human development index (HDI) in 2019. Conclusion: Population aging and population growth increased global lung cancer deaths from 1990 to 2019, despite a decrease in age-specific lung cancer death rates due to GBD risks in most regions. A tailored strategy is needed to reduce the increasing burden of lung cancer due to outpacing demographic drivers of epidemiological change globally and in most regions, taking into account region- or gender-specific risk patterns.","['Fan, Y.', 'Jiang, Y.', 'Gong, L.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Su, Z.', 'Li, X.', 'Wu, H.', 'Pan, H.', 'Wang, J.', 'Meng, Z.', 'Zhou, Q.', 'Qiao, Y.']",10.3389/fpubh.2023.1054200
HIV-related lung cancer in Uganda: a cohort study,"Background: There are few reports on lung cancer among people with HIV (PWH) in Sub-Saharan Africa. In this report, we describe a cohort of PWH and lung cancer at the Uganda Cancer Institute. Methods: This retrospective cohort of PWH and lung cancer was managed at the Uganda Cancer Institute between 2008 and 2018. Sociodemographic and clinical data were abstracted from the patient charts. The median survival from diagnosis to death, loss-to-follow up or 31st December 2018, was estimated. Results: There were 18 people with HIV and lung cancer. The median (interquartile range, IQR) age was 49.5 (38.8–56.0) years, 11 (61.1%) were women and 5 (27.8%) were smokers. Of the 18 PWH, 13 (72.2%) were on antiretroviral therapy and the median (IQR) CD4 count (n = 13) was 380 (243.5–595) cells per mm3. Difficulty in breathing (88.9%), chest pain (78.6%, n = 11), cough (76.5%, n = 17) and weight loss (72.2%) were the commonest symptoms while pleural effusions were observed in 12 (66.7%). In this cohort, 8 (44.4%) were presumptively treated for tuberculosis before the diagnosis of lung cancer. Seven (38.9%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 3. Non-small cell lung cancer was the predominant histological type observed in 17 (94.4%) of whom 14 (82.4%) had adenocarcinoma. Majority of PWH had stage IV disease (88.9%). The median (IQR) survival was 3.3 (1.1–13.2) months and all were either dead (72.2%) or lost-to-follow up (27.8%) at five years from diagnosis. Conclusion: People with HIV and lung cancer in Uganda report low rates of smoking, present with advanced disease and post very poor survival rates. There is need for biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer in HIV.","['Baluku, J.B.', 'Bogere, N.', 'Namiiro, S.', 'Walusansa, V.', 'Andia-Biraro, I.', 'Worodria, W.', 'Kirenga, B.']",10.1186/s13027-022-00439-x
Trends in hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates among patients with lung cancer in Spain between 2010 and 2020,"Background: Lung cancer is the third most frequent tumor and the main cause of death by tumor in Spain. Although the incidence and mortality are still significantly higher in men than in women, the disparity between the sexes is decreasing. The objective of this study was to analyze the evolution of lung cancer hospitalization and in-hospital mortality rates in Spain from 2010 to 2020. Methods: The reports of the Minimum Basic Data Set (MBDS) at hospital discharge were used to retrospectively analyze the data of all patients with a primary diagnosis of lung cancer, according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM). Results: Between 2010 and 2020, there were 315,263 hospitalizations and 70,490 deaths from lung cancer in Spain, the majority (~ 80%) in men. Overall, the rates of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality from lung cancer showed a downward trend throughout the period, although the number of new diagnoses and the absolute number of deaths in women increased. Due to the aging of the population, the degree of comorbidity in patients with lung cancer, although it remains relatively low, is also on the rise. Conclusion: Lung cancer represents a substantial clinical and economic burden for patients and for the National Health System, so it is necessary to promote primary prevention campaigns, as well as to develop more effective population screening measures to detect cancers early and increase the patient survival.","['Galindo-Utrero, A.', 'San-Román-Montero, J.M.', 'Gil-Prieto, R.', 'Gil-de-Miguel, Á.']",10.1186/s12885-022-10205-2
"Lung cancer in never smokers: Distinct population-based patterns by age, sex, and race/ethnicity","Objectives: Epidemiological patterns for lung cancer among never smokers (LCNS) are largely unknown, even though LCNS cases comprise 15% of lung cancers. Past studies were based on epidemiologic or health system cohorts, and not fully representative of the underlying population. The objective was to analyze rates (and trends) of LCNS by sex, age group, and race and ethnicity based on all-inclusive truly population-based sources. Materials and methods: Individual-level data from 2014 to 2018 on smoking status among microscopically-confirmed lung cancer cases from Florida's cancer registry were combined with population denominators adjusted with NHIS data on smoking prevalence to compute population-based LCNS incidence rates and rate ratios. Incidence rates and proportional mortality were ranked against other cancers. Joinpoint regression analyses examined trends. Results: Proportions of LCNS ranged from 9% among White men to 83% among Chinese women. Overall, LCNS was 13% (IRR 1.13, 95%CI 1.08–1.17) more common among men than women, but variation occurred by age group, with female rates exceeding male in younger ages. Age-adjusted rates per 100,000 were highest among Asian/Pacific Islander (API) men and women (15.3 and 13.5, respectively) and Black populations (14.6, 12.9), intermediate for White (13.2, 11.8) and lowest among the Hispanic population (12.1, 10.6). Among API women, LCNS was the second leading cause of cancer death, surpassed only by breast cancer. LCNS trends were stable over time. Conclusion: LCNS is the 11th most frequently occurring cancer in men and 8th in women. LCNS differences by race/ethnicity are small, within a 15% range of the White population's rates. Surprisingly, API men and women have the highest LCNS rates and proportional mortality. As smoking prevalence decreases in the US, LCNS cases will inevitably increase, warranting inquiry into risk factors across the lifespan.","['Pinheiro, P.S.', 'Callahan, K.E.', 'Medina, H.N.', 'Koru-Sengul, T.', 'Kobetz, E.N.', 'Gomez, S.L.', 'de Lima Lopes, G.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2022.10.009
"Determine the Symptom Intensities, Performance and Hopelessness Levels of Advanced Lung Cancer Patients for the Palliative Care Approach","This research was conducted descriptively to determine the symptom intensities, performance and hopelessness levels of advanced lung cancer patients for the palliative care approach. The research sample consisted of 130 patients with advanced lung cancer, who were selected from 600 lung cancer populations in thoracic surgery and intensive care, outpatient chemotherapy, oncology in a university hospital in Turkey. Ethics Committee permission and the patients' written consent was obtained. Study data were collected face to face between January 2020 and July 2020 using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, Karnofsky Performance and Beck Hopelessness Scale. The mean age of the patients was 62.68 ± 8.867, 72.3% were males, and 89.2% were not currently working. The most common symptom in the patients was found to be fatigue 5.46 ± 2.12, worsening in general health and well-being 5.69 ± 1.87, loss of appetite 5.40 ± 2.59, and total symptom score 47.17 ± 19.03. Feelings and expectations about the future 1.40 ± 1.66, loss of motivation 3.43 ± 2.41, hope 2.05 ± 1.75, and total score of hopelessness 7.41 ± 6.01. There was a positive correlation between the patients' hopelessness level and their symptom burden, and a negative correlation was found with Karnofsky performance (P < .05). A significant difference was found between the patients' age, months since diagnosis, gender, education and employment status, stage of the disease, presence of metastases and analgesic use, and hopelessness scores (P < .05). It was determined that the symptom burden of patients with advanced lung cancer increased and as their Karnofsky performance decreased, their hopelessness level further increased. Hopelessness scores are affected by the socio-demographic and disease variables of the patients.","['Dogan, E.', 'Ozcelik, H.']",10.1177/10499091211073528
Very high PD-L1 expression as a prognostic indicator of overall survival among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer receiving anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapies in routine practice,"Purpose: Programmed death or ligand-1 (PD-(L)1) pathway inhibitors confer improved survival as the first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) in patients with PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 + e ≥ 50%) compared to platinum-doublet chemotherapy and have become a standard therapy. Some recent evidence suggests that among aNSCLC patients with PD-L1 + e of ≥50% receiving pembrolizumab monotherapy, very high levels of PD-L1 + e (≥90%) may be associated with better outcomes. We sought to assess whether very high PD-L1 + e (≥90%) compared to high PD-L1 + e (50%–89%) is associated with an overall survival benefit in aNSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-(L)1 monotherapies. Methods: We conducted a single-site retrospective cohort study of aNSCLC patients who initiated PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy as the first-line treatment from October 24, 2016, to August 25, 2021, and had a PD-L1 + e ≥ 50%. The primary outcome was overall survival, measured from the start of the first-line PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy (index date) to date of death or last confirmed activity prior to the cohort exit date. Propensity score-based inverse probability weighting (IPW) was used to control for confounding in Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. Results: One hundred sixty-six patients with aNSCLC receiving PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy met inclusion criteria. 54% were female, 90% received pembrolizumab, median age was 68 years, 70% had non-squamous cell carcinoma, 94% had a history of smoking, 29% had a KRAS mutation, and 37% had very high PD-L1 + e. Unweighted covariates at cohort entry were similar between groups (absolute standardized mean differences [SMDs] <0.1) except for race (SMD = 0.2); age at therapy initiation (SMD = 0.13); smoking status (SMD = 0.13), and BRAF mutation status (SMD = 0.11). After weighting, baseline covariates were well balanced (all absolute SMDs <0.1). In the weighted analysis, having a very high PD-L1 + e was associated with lower mortality (weighted hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.36–0.90) and longer median survival: 3.85 versus 1.49 years. Conclusions: Very high PD-L1 + e (≥90%) was associated with an overall survival benefit over high PD-L1 + e (50%–89%) in patients receiving the first-line PD-(L)1 inhibitor monotherapy in a model controlling for potential confounders. These findings should be confirmed in a larger real-world data set.","['Shah, M.', 'Hubbard, R.A.', 'Mamtani, R.', 'Marmarelis, M.E.', 'Hennessy, S.']",10.1002/pds.5487
Analysis of lung cancer incidence and death in the cancer registration areas of Shanxi Province in 2017,"Objective To investigate the incidence and mortality of lung cancer in the cancer registration areas of Shanxi Province in 2017. Methods The cancer registration data reported by 12 tumor registration areas of Shanxi in 2017 were sorted out and stratified by urban and rural areas and gender. The number of incidence and death, the crude incidence and mortality, the cumulative rate (0-74 years), age ‑ specific incidence and mortality, Chinese population standardized rate and world population standardized rate were calculated. The incidence and mortality were standardized by the 2000 China census standard population composition and Segi's world standard population composition. Results In 2017, there were 2 275 new cases and 1 736 deaths of lung cancer in the tumor registration area of Shanxi Province. The crude incidence rate of lung cancer was 46.72/100 000 (male 63.99/100 000, female 28.80/100 000, urban area 58.05/100 000, rural area 39.09/100 000), Chinese population standardized rate was 31.67/100 000, the world population standardized rate was 32.10/100 000, and the cumulative rate (0-74 years) was 3.87/100 000. The crude mortality rate was 35.65/100,000 (male 49.84/100,000, female 20.93/100,000, urban area 44.53/100,000, rural area 29.67/100 000), Chinese population standardized rate was 23.82/100 000, the world population standardized rate was 24.14/100 000, and the cumulative rate (0-74 years) was 2.69/100,000. Overall, the age‑ specific incidence and mortality of lung cancer in 2017 were at a low level in 0-44 years age group, and increased rapidly after 45 years age group, and reached a peak in 85 years age group. The incidence and mortality of lung cancer in males were higher than that in females. Although there were some differences in the incidence and mortality of patients with different ago range in urban and rural areas, the overall trend was similar. Conclusions Lung cancer is the most common malignant tumor threatening the health of residents in Shanxi Province. Male, urban areas and middle‑aged and elderly population are the focus of cancer prevention and control in Shanxi Province. Lung cancer prevention and control should be targeted carried out according to the differences between urban and rural areas and gender.","['Zhaohui, M.', 'Ling, C.', 'Xuerong, G.', 'Wangfei, C.', 'Xinchen, W.', 'Ruifeng, Z.', 'Yongzhen, Z.']",10.3760/cma.j.cn115355-20220420-00240
Causes of death and conditional survival estimates of long-term lung cancer survivors,"Introduction: Lung cancer ranks the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. This retrospective cohort study was designed to determine time-dependent death hazards of diverse causes and conditional survival of lung cancer. Methods: We collected 816,436 lung cancer cases during 2000-2015 in the SEER database, after exclusion, 612,100 cases were enrolled for data analyses. Cancer-specific survival, overall survival and dynamic death hazard were assessed in this study. Additionally, based on the FDA approval time of Nivolumab in 2015, we evaluated the effect of immunotherapy on metastatic patients’ survival by comparing cases in 2016-2018 (immunotherapy era, n=7135) and those in 2013-2016 (non-immunotherapy era, n=42061). Results: Of the 612,100 patients, 285,705 were women, the mean (SD) age was 68.3 (11.0) years old. 252,558 patients were characterized as lung adenocarcinoma, 133,302 cases were lung squamous cell carcinoma, and only 78,700 cases were small cell lung carcinomas. TNM stage was I in 140,518 cases, II in 38,225 cases, III in 159,095 cases, and IV in 274,262 patients. 164,394 cases underwent surgical intervention. The 5-y overall survival and cancer-specific survival were 54.2% and 73.8%, respectively. The 5-y conditional survival rate of cancer-specific survival is improved in a time-dependent pattern, while conditional overall survival tends to be steady after 5-y follow-up. Except from age, hazard disparities of other risk factors (such as stage and surgery) diminished over time according to the conditional survival curves. After 8 years since diagnosis, mortality hazard from other causes became higher than that from lung cancer. This critical time point was earlier in elder patients while was postponed in patients with advanced stages. Moreover, both cancer-specific survival and overall survival of metastatic patients in immunotherapy era were significantly better than those in non-immunotherapy era (P<0.001), indicating that immunotherapeutic intervention indeed bring remarkable benefits to advanced lung cancer patients. Conclusions: Our findings expand on previous studies by demonstrating that non-lung-cancer related death risk becomes more and more predominant over the course of follow-up, and we establish a personalized web-based calculator to determine this critical time point for long-term survivors. We also confirmed the survival benefit of advanced lung cancer patients in immunotherapy era.","['Zhang, Q.', 'Dai, Y.', 'Liu, H.', 'Sun, W.', 'Huang, Y.', 'Gong, Z.', 'Dai, S.', 'Kong, H.', 'Xie, W.']",10.3389/fimmu.2022.1012247
Factors associated with cancer survival disparities among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples compared with other Australians: A systematic review,"Background: While cancer survival among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples has improved over time, they continue to experience poorer cancer survival than other Australians. Key drivers of these disparities are not well understood. This systematic review aimed to summarise existing evidence on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cancer survival disparities and identify influential factors and potential solutions. Methods: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, multiple databases were systematically searched for English language peer-reviewed articles on cancer survival by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status published from 1/1/2008 to 4/05/2022. Observational studies presenting adjusted survival measures in relation to potential causal factors for disparities were included. Articles were screened independently by two authors. Included studies were critically assessed using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Results: Thirty population-based and predominantly state-level studies were included. A consistent pattern of poorer unadjusted cancer survival for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples was evident. Studies varied widely in the covariates adjusted for including a combination of socio-demographics, cancer stage, comorbidities, and treatment. Potential contributions of these factors varied by cancer type. For lung and female breast cancer, adjusting for treatment and comorbidities reduced the survival disparity, which, while still elevated was no longer statistically significant. This pattern was also evident for cervical cancer after adjustment for stage and treatment. However, most studies for all cancers combined, or colorectal cancer, reported that unexplained survival disparities remained after adjusting for various combinations of covariates. Conclusions: While some of the poorer survival faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cancer patients can be explained, substantial disparities likely to be related to Aboriginal determinants, remain. It is imperative that future research consider innovative study designs and strength-based approaches to better understand cancer survival for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and to inform evidence-based action.","['Dasgupta, P.', 'Harris, V.M.', 'Garvey, G.', 'Aitken, J.F.', 'Baade, P.D.']",10.3389/fonc.2022.968400
Profiling symptom burden and its influencing factors at discharge for patients undergoing lung cancer surgery: a cross-sectional analysis,"BACKGROUND: Following lung cancer surgery, patients often experience severe symptoms which are not properly assessed at discharge. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical presentation at discharge and the influencing factors of postoperative symptoms in patients who have undergone lung cancer surgery. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analysed data from patients who participated in a prospective cohort study that enrolled patients who underwent lung cancer surgery at six tertiary hospitals in the People's Republic of China, from November 2017 to January 2020. Patient symptoms at discharge were measured using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Lung Cancer module. The five core symptoms were defined according to ratings of moderate to severe symptoms (≥ 4 on a 0-10 scale). A multivariate linear regression model was used to identify the influencing factors of each symptom at discharge. RESULTS: Among the 366 participants, 51.9% were male and the mean (SD) age was 55.81 (10.43) years. At discharge, the core symptoms were cough (36.4%), pain (28.2%), disturbed sleep (26.3%), shortness of breath (25.8%), and fatigue (24.3%), and more than half of the participants (54.6%) had one to five of the core symptoms, with moderate to severe severity. A low annual income and the use of two chest tubes were significantly associated (P = 0.030 and 0.014, respectively) with higher mean scores of the core symptoms. CONCLUSION: Though clinically eligible for discharge, more than half of the participants had severe symptoms at discharge after lung cancer surgery. Special attention should be given to patients who have two chest tubes after surgery and those who have a low annual income.","['Liao, J.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Dai, W.', 'Wei, X.', 'Yu, H.', 'Yang, P.', 'Xie, T.', 'Li, Q.', 'Liu, X.', 'Shi, Q.']",10.1186/s13019-022-01974-9
Analysis of Eligibility for Lung Cancer Screening by Race after 2021 Changes to US Preventive Services Task Force Screening Guidelines,"Importance: Lung cancer incidence and mortality have disproportionate consequences for racial and ethnic minority populations. The extent to which the 2021 changes to the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening guidelines have reduced the racial disparity gap in lung cancer screening eligibility is not known. Objective: To assess the consequences of the changes in USPSTF low-dose computed tomography eligibility criteria for lung cancer screening between 2013 and 2021 among Black and White community-dwelling adults. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke study, a prospective longitudinal cohort study of community-dwelling Black and White adults 45 years and older who were initially recruited across the US between January 2003 and October 2007, with ongoing follow-up. All participants who would have been potentially eligible for lung cancer screening based on the 2021 USPSTF guidelines (N = 14 285) were included. Follow-up data for the current cohort study were collected and analyzed between January 2013 and December 2017, with final analysis performed in 2021. Exposures: Self-reported Black vs White race. Primary Outcomes and Measures: Differences in the proportion of Black vs White participants eligible for lung cancer screening according to 2013 and 2021 guidelines were assessed using modified Poisson models with robust SEs. Associations between important covariates (demographic characteristics and social factors associated with health), including interaction and dissimilarity indices (2 measures of residential segregation), and differences in screening eligibility were also examined. Results: Among 14 285 participants (mean [SD] age, 64.7 [7.5] years; 7675 men [53.7%]), 5787 (40.5%) self-identified as Black and 8498 (59.5%) as White. Based on the 2013 USPSTF guidelines, 1109 of 5787 Black participants (19.2%) and 2313 of 8498 White participants (27.2%) were eligible for lung cancer screening (difference, -8.06 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.44 to -6.67 percentage points). Based on the 2021 guidelines, 1667 of 5787 Black participants (28.8%) and 2940 of 8498 White participants (34.6%) were eligible for screening (difference, -5.73 percentage points; 95% CI, -7.28 to -4.19 percentage points). After adjustment for differences in individual characteristics and residential segregation, the 2013 difference in screening eligibility among Black vs White participants was -12.66 percentage points (95% CI, -14.71 to -10.61 percentage points), and the 2021 difference was -12.15 percentage points (95% CI, -14.37 to -9.93 percentage points). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, 2021 changes to the USPSTF lung cancer screening guidelines were associated with reductions in but not elimination of existing eligibility disparities in lung cancer screening among Black and White adults. These findings suggest that accounting for factors beyond age and pack-years of smoking is needed when tailoring guidelines to improve screening eligibility among groups at high risk of lung cancer.","['Pinheiro, L.C.', 'Groner, L.', 'Soroka, O.', 'Prosper, A.E.', 'Jack, K.', 'Tamimi, R.M.', 'Safford, M.', 'Phillips, E.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.29741
Disparities in radiation therapy utilization for cancer patients in Victoria,"Introduction: To evaluate the proportion of cancer patients who received radiation therapy (RT) within 12 months of cancer diagnosis (RTU12) and identify factors associated with RTU12. Methods: This is a population-based cohort of individuals with incident cancer, diagnosed between 2013 and 2017 in Victoria. Data linkages were performed between the Victorian Cancer Registry and Victorian Radiotherapy Minimum Dataset. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had RTU12. For the three most common cancers (i.e., prostate, breast and lung cancer), the time trend in RTU12 and factors associated with RTU12 were evaluated. Results: The overall RTU12 in our study cohort was 26–20% radical RT and 6% palliative RT. Of the 21,735 men with prostate cancer, RTU12 was 17%, with no significant change over time (P-trend = 0.53). In multivariate analyses, increasing age and lower socioeconomic status were independently associated with higher RTU12 for prostate cancer. Of the 20,883 women with breast cancer, RTU12 was 64%, which increased from 62% in 2013 to 65% in 2017 (P-trend < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, age, socioeconomic status and area of residency were independently associated with RTU12 for breast cancer. Of the 13,093 patients with lung cancer, RTU12 was 42%, with no significant change over time (P-trend = 0.16). In multivariate analyses, younger age, male and lower socioeconomic status were independently associated with higher RTU12. Conclusion: In this large population-based state-wide cohort of cancer patients, only 1 in 4 had RT within 12 months of diagnosis. There were marked sociodemographic disparities in RTU12 for prostate, breast and lung cancer patients.","['Ong, W.L.', 'Finn, N.', 'Te Marvelde, L.', 'Hornby, C.', 'Milne, R.L.', 'Hanna, G.G.', 'Pitson, G.', 'Elsaleh, H.', 'Millar, J.L.', 'Foroudi, F.']",10.1111/1754-9485.13407
The Role of Thoracic Radiation Therapy Dosing in the Treatment of Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Study Based on the National Cancer Database,"Purpose: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly fatal disease, but its treatment has remained relatively unchanged for decades. Randomized clinical trials evaluating radiation therapy (RT) dosing and fractionation have yielded mixed results on overall survival (OS). Methods and Materials: We identified 2261 patients with limited-stage (LS) SCLC undergoing definitive RT at 1.5, 1.8, and 2.0 Gy dose per fraction, concurrently with chemotherapy, between 2004 and 2015 within the National Cancer Database. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards regression was used to investigate whether there was any survival difference among patients who received hyperfractionated, twice-daily RT at 1.5 Gy per fraction (HF1.5) and once-daily, standard fractionation RT at 1.8 Gy (SF1.8) or 2.0 Gy (SF2.0) per fraction. Subgroup analyses by age, sex, race, time to RT, facility type, and Charlson comorbidity index were also performed. Results: All stage median OS rates for HF1.5, SF1.8, and SF2.0 Gy groups were 21.6, 18.9, and 19.4 months, respectively (log-rank P =.0079). Multivariate analyses adjusting for demographic factors, socioeconomic status, tumor characteristics, and year of diagnosis showed SF1.8 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.30, 1.03-1.63) and SF2.0 (HR = 1.20, 1.00-1.45) was associated with worse 1-year survival compared with HF1.5. This association was more evident in stage IIb-stage III than stage I to stage IIa patients. Propensity score–weighted analysis showed similar results. Stratified analyses showed the significant associations were confined to male or black patients, those aged >65 years, with 1 comorbidity, who had waited >60 days to start RT or were treated at an academic medical center. Conclusions: Analyses of real-world treatment outcome data showed that receiving hyperfractionated, twice-daily RT was associated with improved survival among patients with LS-SCLC compared with standard, once-daily fractionation regimens at 1 year after diagnosis, particularly for subsets of patients. Some associations retained statistical significance 3 years postdiagnosis.","['Shidal, C.', 'Osmundson, E.C.', 'Cui, Y.', 'Yoon, H.-S.', 'Bailey, C.E.', 'Cai, Q.', 'Shu, X.-O.']",10.1016/j.adro.2022.100907
Projections of smoking-related cancer mortality in Australia to 2044,"Background While many high-income countries including Australia have successfully implemented a range of tobacco control policies, smoking remains the leading preventable cause of cancer death in Australia. We have projected Australian mortality rates for cancer types, which have been shown to have an established relationship with cigarette smoking and estimated numbers of cancer deaths attributable to smoking to 2044. Methods Cancer types were grouped according to the proportion of cases currently caused by smoking: 8%-30% and >30%. For each group, an age-period- cohort model or generalised linear model with cigarette smoking exposure as a covariate was selected based on the model fit statistics and validation using observed data. The smoking-attributable fraction (SAF) was calculated for each smoking-related cancer using Australian smoking prevalence data and published relative risks. Results Despite the decreasing mortality rates projected for the period 2015-2019 to 2040-2044 for both men and women, the overall number of smoking-related cancer deaths is estimated to increase by 28.7% for men and 35.8% for women: from 138 707 (77 839 men and 60 868 women) in 2015-2019 to 182 819 (100 153 men and 82 666 women) in 2040-2044. Over the period 2020-2044, there will be 254 583 cancer deaths (173 943 men and 80 640 women) directly attributable to smoking, with lung, larynx, oesophagus and oral (comprising lip, oral cavity and pharynx) cancers having the largest SAFs. Interpretation Cigarette smoking will cause over 250 000 cancer deaths in Australia from 2020 to 2044. Continued efforts in tobacco control remain a public health priority, even in countries where smoking prevalence has substantially declined.","['Luo, Q.', 'Steinberg, J.', 'Yu, X.Q.', 'Weber, M.', 'Caruana, M.', 'Yap, S.', 'Grogan, P.B.', 'Banks, E.', ""O'connell, D.L."", 'Canfell, K.']",10.1136/jech-2021-218252
Sex disparities in lung cancer survival rates based on screening status,"Objective: Low dose computed tomography (LDCT) became the standard method for lung cancer (LC) screening in 2013. However, it is unclear whether there are differences in survival rates based on sex and whether the differences depend on screening status. We aimed to evaluate the LC survival rates between females and males based on screening. Material and methods: This retrospective cohort study examined data from the Boston LC Study (BLCS) between 2013 and 2021. LC screening depends on patients’ demographics (age and smoking history) to determine whether a person is a high-risk individual and, therefore, undergo LDCT. Descriptive statistics were calculated for race, age, histology, smoking history, stage, and treatment. These variables' distributions were compared between sex and screening status using t-test and chi-square, respectively. Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare survival between sex and screening. Propensity score matching was applied to account for selection bias in screening when evaluating the association between screening and stage. Results: A total of 1,216 LC patients were identified with a screening incidence of 9.4 %, among whom 56 % were female. Unscreened males had 1.59 times higher risk of mortality than unscreened females (P=.0002) and had a worse 5-year survival (male 50 %; 95 %CI, 0.38,0.6 vs female 70 %; 95 %CI,0.62,0.76). In contrast, there were no significant differences in survival between sexes among screened. In a balanced cohort of screened and unscreened, the odds of being diagnosed at late stages for females and smokers were 1.33 and 2.51 times that of males and nonsmokers; however, there were no statistical significance. Conclusion: Unscreened females had a lower risk of mortality and better survival than unscreened males, while among the screened population, there was no difference in the overall survival. These observations demonstrate the influence of sex on survival prognosis in LC when screening is not performed.","['Rodriguez Alvarez, A.A.', 'Yuming, S.', 'Kothari, J.', 'Digumarthy, S.R.', 'Byrne, N.M.', 'Li, Y.', 'Christiani, D.C.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2022.07.015
Efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only a minority of NSCLC patients benefit from ICIs, and whether the magnitude of benefit is specific factor-dependent remains unclear. We performed a systematic review to improve our understanding of clinicopathologic and biomolecular features associated with improved survival upon treatment with ICIs for NSCLC. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus from database inception to August 31, 2021, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing overall survival (OS) in NSCLC treated with ICIs vs control therapies. We calculated the pooled OS hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI in subgroups using a random-effects model, and assessed the heterogeneity between the paired estimates using an interaction test. Results: A total of 23 RCTs involving 15,829 patients were included. We found that wild-type EGFR, high PD-L1 expression, and high bTMB were associated with a significant OS benefit from ICIs, but not mutant EGFR, low PD-L1 expression, and low bTMB. The differences of OS benefit between wild-type and mutant EGFR (HR=1.53, 95%CI 1.13-2.08), high and low PD-L1 (HR=1.35; 95%CI 1.14-1.61), high and low bTMB (HR=1.71; 95%CI 1.17-2.52) were statistically significant. OS benefit was found in all subgroups regardless of sex, age, ECOG PS, histology, smoking history, baseline brain metastasis, race, and region, and the interaction test demonstrated no significant difference of the OS benefit between these opposed subgroups (e.g. male vs female). Conclusions: Wild-type EGFR, high PD-L1 expression, and high bTMB are associated with a greater magnitude of efficacy from ICIs vs control therapies in NSCLC. However, the administration of ICIs should not be restricted to other clinicopathological factors (sex, smoking history, race, etc.).","['Yang, F.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Tang, L.', 'Mansfield, A.S.', 'Adjei, A.A.', 'Leventakos, K.', 'Duma, N.', 'Wei, J.', 'Wang, L.', 'Liu, B.', 'Molina, J.R.']",10.3389/fonc.2022.955440
"Small cell lung cancer in young patients: trends in sociodemographic factors, diagnosis, treatment, and survival","Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in patients <50 years old has unique socioeconomic and clinical implications. We aimed to examine the demographics, treatment patterns, and survival of young patients with SCLC and compared them to older adults. Methods: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried to identify SCLC cases diagnosed from 2004 to 2016. Patients were divided into three age groups: ≥18–<50, ≥50–<70, and ≥70 years. Patient characteristics were evaluated for survival within each age group. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess survival. Results: Of the 172,453 evaluated SCLC patients (median age 66 years), 8,792 were ≥18–<50 years old. Compared to the older groups, patients under 50 were more likely to be Black, uninsured or on Medicaid, have household income <$30,000, and present with stage III or IV disease (P<0.0001 for all). While young patients were more likely to receive guideline-concordant care (GCC), the hazard of death increased to 1.96 (95% CI: 1.80–2.14; P<0.0001) with receipt of nonstandard therapy. Private insurance, female gender, nonWhite race, Hispanic ethnicity, and higher income were associated with better survival. The youngest cohort had significantly better survival overall when compared to the older patients (P<0.0001), but the survival advantage was reduced with the advancing stage. Conclusions: SCLC patients under 50 years old represent a socioeconomically disadvantaged group with advanced disease at presentation. Despite having fewer comorbidities and being offered guideline-concordant treatment, younger patients with SCLC have only marginally better survival than older patients in advanced stages.","['Lee, M.H.', 'Qureshi, M.M.', 'Suzuki, K.', 'Everett, P.', 'Tapan, U.', 'Mak, K.S.']",10.21037/jtd-22-210
Identification of Distinct Symptom Profiles in Cancer Patients Using a Pre-Specified Symptom Cluster,"Context: Pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression often co-occur in oncology patients and negatively impact quality of life (QOL). Objectives: Study purposes were to identify subgroups of patients with distinct symptom profiles based on their experiences with a pre-specified symptom cluster (i.e., pain, fatigue, depression, sleep disturbance) and to identify demographic, clinical, and symptom characteristics and QOL outcomes associated with each distinct profile. Methods: Patients with breast, lung, gastrointestinal, and gynecologic cancers (n = 1340) were recruited from outpatient clinics during their first or second cycle of chemotherapy. They completed valid and reliable measures of pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance. depression, and QOL prior to their next dose of chemotherapy. Latent class profile analysis was used to identify the patient subgroups. Differences among the profiles were evaluated using parametric and non-parametric tests. Results: Three distinct profiles were identified (i.e., Low (44.0%), Moderate (45.1%), High (10.8%). Compared to Low class, Moderate and High classes were younger and more likely to be female. Compared to the other two classes, High class was less likely to be married/partnered and employed, more likely to have a lower income and childcare responsibilities, had lower functional status, a higher body mass index, and exercised less. For both QOL scales, differences in subscale and total scores followed the same pattern (Low>Moderate>High). Conclusions: Over 55% of patients undergoing chemotherapy had a moderate to high symptom burden associated with these four common co-occurring symptoms. Multimodal interventions are needed to decrease symptom burden and improve QOL outcomes in these patients.","['Hammer, M.J.', 'Cooper, B.', 'Paul, S.M.', 'Kober, K.M.', 'Cartwright, F.', 'Conley, Y.P.', 'Wright, F.', 'Levine, J.D.', 'Miaskowski, C.']",10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2022.03.007
Advanced age is not the decisive factor in chemotherapy of small cell lung cancer: a population-based study,"OBJECTIVE: There is limited research on the impact of chemotherapy on the prognosis of different age group patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The aim of this study was to explore the impact of chemotherapy on survival prognosis of elderly patients with SCLC. METHODS: Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, 57,460 SCLC patients between 2004 and 2015 were identified and divided into a ≤ 80 years group (n = 50,941) and a >80 years group (n = 6,519). Confounding factors were controlled by propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Kaplan Meier (KM) analysis was performed to determine the impact of chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) and lung-cancer specific survival (LCSS) of the patients. Other variables that could affect survival of SCLC patients were also examined by COX analysis. RESULTS: KM analysis showed that both OS and LCSS were improved in chemotherapy group compared to those in non-chemotherapy group (log rank P < 0.001) in both age groups after PSM. Cox analysis demonstrated the survival benefit of chemotherapy in both ≤ 80 years group (OS: HR 0.435; 95% CI 0.424-0.447; LCSS: HR 0.436; 95% CI 0.424-0.448) and >80 years group (OS: HR 0.424; 95% CI 0.397-0.451; LCSS: HR 0.415; 95% CI 0.389-0.444). Additionally, the following parameters had a negative impact on survival of elderly patients: male sex, tumor location in main bronchus, increased stage, bilateral tumor, no surgery or radiation, and lower median household income. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients with SCLC should be encouraged to receive chemotherapy provided their general conditions permit.","['Rao, H.', 'Zhou, S.', 'Mei, A.', 'Yao, A.', 'Xie, S.']",10.18632/aging.204114
Palliative non-small cell lung cancer treatment and end-of-life care stratified by sex and childlessness: an important interplay in unmarried patients?,"Purpose: To analyze the interplay of sex and presence of children in unmarried patients with non-small cell lung cancer, because previous studies suggested sex-related disparities. Adult children may participate in treatment decisions and provision of social support or home care. Methods: Retrospective single-institution analysis of 186 unmarried deceased patients, managed according to national guidelines outside of clinical trials. Due to the absence of other oncology care providers in the region and the availability of electronic health records, all aspects of longitudinal care were captured. Results: Eighty-eight female and 98 male patients were included, the majority of whom had children. Comparable proportions in all four strata did not receive active therapy. Involvement of the palliative care team was similar, too. Patients without children were more likely to receive systemic therapy (39% utilization in women with children, 67% in women without children, 41% in men with children, 52% in men without children; p = 0.05). During the last 3 months of life, female patients spent significantly more days in hospital than their male counterparts. Place of death was not significantly different. Home death was equally uncommon in each group. In the multivariate analysis, survival was associated with age and cancer stage, in contrast to sex and presence of children. Conclusion: In contrast to studies from other healthcare systems, unmarried male patients were managed in a largely similar fashion to their female counterparts and with similar survival outcome. Unexpectedly, patients without children more often received systemic anti-cancer treatment.","['Nieder, C.', 'Aanes, S.G.', 'Haukland, E.C.']",10.1007/s00520-022-06987-7
Identifying Determinants of Disparities in Lung Cancer Survival Rates from Electronic Health Record Data,"The goal of this pilot study was to identify significant factors that affect disparities in lung cancer survival. A de-identified dataset was generated by querying electronic health records (EHR) from an academic medical center in New York City between January 2003 and November 2020. Socio-demographic characteristics, cancer stage, and genetic profile were analyzed using logistic regression. Two subsets of adult patients were identified: patients who were deceased less than 1 year after diagnosis and patients who survived over 5 years after diagnosis. Male, Black and Hispanic patients and those who were diagnosed in later stages were the people most susceptible to a shorter length of survival after cancer diagnoses. In addition, we identified three genetic oncodrivers (KRAS, EGFR and TP53) which were highly correlated with the length of survival after lung cancer diagnoses and their distribution was associated with race. We concluded that EHR data provide important insights on cancer survival disparities.","['Cui, W.', 'Finkelstein, J.']",10.3233/SHTI220567
Primary healthcare professionals' perspectives on patient help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer incidence and mortality worldwide. Prompt patient help-seeking for signs and symptoms suggestive of lung cancer is crucial for early referral, diagnosis, and survivorship. However, individuals with potential lung cancer symptoms tend to delay help-seeking. This qualitative study explored perceived barriers to patient help-seeking and strategies to enhance help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms from the perspective of primary healthcare professionals. METHODS: Semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with 36 primary healthcare professionals. Data were collected via videoconferencing. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The following two themes were created from the data: (i) perceived barriers to patient help-seeking for signs and symptoms of concern and (ii) facilitating early patient presentation for signs and symptoms of concern. Some participants believed that the high cost of a general practitioner visit, long waiting times, and previous bad experiences with the healthcare system would deter patients from seeking help for symptoms of lung cancer. Perceived patient-related barriers to help-seeking related to the different emotions associated with a potential cancer diagnosis as well as stigma, embarrassment, and guilt felt by smokers. Sociodemographic factors such as drug use, homelessness, living in rural areas, and being male and older were also perceived to impede patient help-seeking. The negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer help-seeking also featured strongly. Participants recommended several strategies to enable patients to seek help for symptoms of concern including targeted educational campaigns focussing on symptoms (e.g., cough) rather than behaviours (e.g., smoking), accessible and free health services, and using patients' support networks. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-related and healthcare system-related barriers to help-seeking for lung cancer warning signs and symptoms include cost of healthcare, cancer fear, and various sociodemographic factors.

Impact of Oncological Treatment on Perceived Stigmatization - A Register-Based Study,"Background Studies on stigmatization of cancer patients show a moderate or high relevance of perceived stigmatization. To date, there are no studies with explicit focus on stigma in relation to oncological therapy. We investigated the role of oncological therapy on perceived stigma in a large sample. Methods Quantitative data from 770 patients (47,4% women; 88%≥50 years) with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer were analyzed as part of a registry-based bicentric study. Stigma was assessed with the German version of the SIS-D; the validated instrument includes four subscales in addition to a total score. Data were analyzed using the t-test and multiple regression with various sociodemographic and medical predictors. Results Of the 770 cancer patients, 367 (47,7%) received chemotherapy, possibly in combination with other therapy (surgery, radiotherapy). All stigma scales showed significant mean differences (effect sizes up to d=0,49) with higher scores for patients receiving chemotherapy. The multiple regression analyses of the respective SIS-scales demonstrate a significant influence of the variables age (β≤- 0,266) and depressivity (β≤0,627) on perceived stigma in all five models, and (in four models) a significant influence of the variable chemotherapy (β≤0,140). Radiotherapy shows only a weak influence in all models and surgery has no relevance. The explained variance ranges from R2=27 to 46,5%. Discussion and Conclusion The findings support the assumption of an association of oncological therapy, especially chemotherapy, on the perceived stigmatization of cancer patients. Relevant predictors are depression and younger (<50) age. These (vulnerable) groups should therefore receive special attention and psycho-oncological care in clinical practice. Further research on the course and mechanisms of therapy-related stigmatization is also necessary.","['Hornemann, B.', 'Haering, C.', 'Hentschel, L.', 'Rentsch, A.', 'Taubenheim, S.', 'Mehnert-Theuerkauf, A.', 'Esser, P.', 'Ernst, J.']",10.1055/a-2003-9523
Prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms in patients with lung cancer,"Objective: Concomitance of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and primary lung cancer (LC) is not uncommon due to several shared risk factors. To evaluate the incidence of this association, analysis of the National Inpatient Sample database was utilized. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the National Inpatient Sample database between 2014 and 2018 for all patients diagnosed with primary LC was performed. The differences in the reported findings between the LC and control groups were assessed using the Pearson χ2, Fisher exact, Student t, and/or Mann-Whitney U tests where appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine independent predictors of the presence of documented AAA. Results: A total of 158,904 patients were identified. Of these, 2430 patients (1.53%) were diagnosed with AAA and 156,474 (98.47%) without AAA. In the multivariable model, LC patients had higher odds of AAA compared with the general population (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.35-1.51). In all age groups, female smokers had a higher rate of AAA compared with female nonsmokers (age <60 years, 0.13% vs 0.04%; 60-69 years, 0.77% vs 0.34%; 70-79 years, 1.65% vs 0.69%; and >80 years, 2.63% vs 1.31%; all P <.001). Conclusions: LC and AAA share similar risk factors, which may explain the higher AAA prevalence among patients with LC. Given the higher prevalence of AAA in smokers compared with nonsmokers across all age groups in both male and female patients with LC, further sex-based studies investigating the overall mortality and morbidity benefits of AAA screening among patients with LC are highly warranted. This consideration would potentially address the sex disparity in outcomes for AAA management.","['Alnahhal, K.I.', 'Urhiafe, V.', 'Narayanan, M.', 'Irshad, A.', 'Salehi, P.']",10.1016/j.jvs.2021.09.037
Cancer Survival in Adults in Spain: A Population-Based Study of the Spanish Network of Cancer Registries (REDECAN),"The assessment of cancer survival at the population level is essential for monitoring progress in cancer control. We aimed to assess cancer survival and its trends in adults in Spain. Individual records of 601,250 adults with primary cancer diagnosed during 2002–2013 and followed up to 2015 were included from 13 population-based cancer registries. We estimated net survival up to five years after diagnosis and analyzed absolute changes between 2002–2007 and 2008–2013. Estimates were age-standardized. Analyses were performed for 29 cancer groups, by age and sex. Overall, age-standardized five-year net survival was higher in women (61.7%, 95% CI 61.4–62.1%) than in men (55.3%, 95% CI 55.0–55.6%), and ranged by cancer from 7.2% (pancreas) to 89.6% (prostate) in men, and from 10.0% (pancreas) to 93.1% (thyroid) in women in the last period. Survival declined with age, showing different patterns by cancer. Between both periods, age-standardized five-year net survival increased overall by 3.3% (95% CI 3.0–3.7%) in men and 2.5% (95% CI 2.0–3.0%) in women, and for most cancer groups. Improvements were greater in patients younger than 75 years than in older patients. Chronic myeloid leukemia and myeloma showed the largest increases. Among the most common malignancies, the greatest absolute increases in survival were observed for colon (5.0%, 95% CI 4.0–6.0%) and rectal cancers (4.5%, 95% CI 3.2–5.9%). Survival improved even for some cancers with poor prognosis (pancreas, esophagus, lung, liver, and brain cancer). Further investigation of possible sociodemographic inequalities is warranted. This study contributes to the evaluation of cancer control and health services’ effectiveness.","['Guevara, M.', 'Molinuevo, A.', 'Salmerón, D.', 'Marcos-Gragera, R.', 'Carulla, M.', 'Chirlaque, M.-D.', 'Camblor, M.R.', 'Alemán, A.', 'Rojas, D.', 'Batllés, A.V.', 'Chico, M.', 'Chillarón, R.J.', 'de Munain, A.L.', 'de Castro, V.', 'Sánchez, M.-J.', 'Ramalle-Gómara, E.', 'Franch, P.', 'Galceran, J.', 'Ardanaz, E.']",10.3390/cancers14102441
Results and cost-effectiveness analysis of lung cancer screening for urban residents in Xuzhou from 2014 to 2019,"Objective: To analyze the results of lung cancer screening for urban residents in Xuzhou City from 2014 to 2019, and conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of lung cancer screening projects to provide a reference for the optimization of lung cancer screening strategies. Methods: Based on the urban cancer early diagnosis and treatment project carried out in Xuzhou City from 2014 to 2019, the high-risk rate of lung cancer, compliance rate, and lesion detection rate of urban residents aged 40-74 were analyzed, and the differences in rates between different groups were compared by χ2 tests. We calculated and compared health economics evaluation indicators such as direct cost, indirect cost, early detection cost index (EDCI), etc. Results: A total of 100 695 questionnaires were completed and 18 508 were assessed as high-risk groups for lung cancer, with a high-risk rate of 18. 38%; the high-risk rate of men is higher than that of women (χ2=2 415.22, P<0.001). Among them, 8798 received low-dose spiral computed tomography (LDCT) examination, the compliance rate was 47.54%, and the compliance rate of women was higher than that of men (χ2=262.06, P<0.001). Totally 470 cases (5. 34%) with positive nodules were detected, among which 83 cases (0.94%) were suspected of lung cancer. The cost of each positive nodule detected was 14 984. 81 yuan, the cost of each case of suspected lung cancer detected was 84 853. 75 yuan, and EDCI was 1. 22. Conclusions: The high-risk rate, screening compliance rate, and detection rate of positive lesions for lung cancer screening in Xuzhou City need to be improved. Health economics evaluation and analysis initially show that LDCT has cost-effective value in the detection of early lung cancer, but whether it is suitable for large-scale screening still needs to be confirmed via further in-depth research.","['Yang, Q.', 'Liu, D.', 'Lou, P.-A.', 'Kong, Y.-X.', 'Dong, Z.-M.', 'Zhang, P.', 'Chen, P.-P.', 'Chang, G.-Q.', 'Dong, D.']",10.16073/j.cnki.cjcpt.2022.07.03
"One-off low-dose CT for lung cancer screening in China: a multicentre, population-based, prospective cohort study","Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Data on the effectiveness of one-off low-dose CT (LDCT) in reducing lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality are needed to inform screening programmes in countries with limited medical resources. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of one-off LDCT screening in the early detection of lung cancer in China. Methods: A multicentre, population-based, prospective cohort study was done in 12 cities of eight provinces across China, recruiting individuals aged 40–74 years who were asymptomatic for lung cancer with no lung cancer history. Participants were classified as at high risk or low risk of lung cancer using a sex-specific risk score that incorporated cigarette smoking, level of physical activity, occupational exposures, history of chronic respiratory diseases, family history of lung cancer, diet, and passive smoking (women only). Participants at high risk were invited for a one-off LDCT scan and were classified into screened and non-screened groups on the basis of whether or not they had the scan. Lung cancer incidence density, lung cancer mortality, and all-cause mortality were calculated for the screened and non-screened groups. The effectiveness of a one-off LDCT scan was evaluated by a comparison of the screened and non-screened groups in terms of lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in the period from cohort entry until administrative censoring (June 20, 2020). Inverse probability weighting was adopted to account for potential imbalanced factors between the two groups and Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the weighted associations between mortality and one-off LDCT scans. Findings: Between Feb 19, 2013, and Oct 31, 2018, 1 032 639 individuals were assessed for eligibility. 1 016 740 participants were enrolled in the study, of whom 3581 had a lung cancer diagnosis after a median follow-up of 3·6 years (IQR 2·8–5·1). Among the 223 302 participants at high risk, 79 581 (35·6%) had an LDCT scan (screened group) and 143 721 (64·4%) did not (non-screened group). After inverse probability weighting, lung cancer incidence density was 47·0% higher (hazard ratio 1·47 [95% CI 1·27–1·70]; p<0·0001), lung cancer mortality was 31·0% lower (0·69 [95% CI 0·53–0·92]; p=0·010) and all-cause mortality was 32·0% lower (0·68 [0·57–0·82]; p<0·0001) for participants in the screened group compared with those in the non-screened group. Interpretation: One-off LDCT screening was associated with significantly lower lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality in a large population in China. Our results point to the promise of one-off LDCT screening in countries with limited medical resources. Further studies are needed to explore interactions by subgroup—including sex, age, smoking status, and economic status—to develop population-specific screening strategies.

Impact of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) publication and Medicare Lung cancer screening payment on lung cancer incidence rates: An interrupted time series analysis,"Introduction: Explore the impact of the Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST-September-2011) and the Medicare approval for CT-screening (CT-LCS-AP-February-2015) on lung cancer incidence rates, mortality, and the percentage of early-stage lung cancer diagnosis (ESLCD-T1-T2N0M0). Methods: Retrospective interrupted time series analysis using SEER-18 database. All individuals with lung cancer (LC) diagnosis from 2006 to 2016 were included. The effect of NLST and CT-AP-2015 on the monthly percentage of early-stage ESLCD was the primary outcome, additionally LC incidence and mortality rates were calculated. The analysis was performed by age, sex, race, marital status, insurance status, and household income. Bivariate and multivariate models were used to identify predictors of ESLCD. Results: The study cohort was composed by 388,207 individuals, 69 years old in average, 46.6 % female, and 81.1 % white. LC incidence and mortality rates declined from 2006 to 2016 without association with NLST-September-2011 and CT-LCS-AP-February-2015. The percentage of ESLCD increased over time for all groups. Overall rates of ESLCD started at 18 % in January-2006 and increased to 25 % by December-2016. The intervention NLST-2011 did not show an impact in the ESLCD while the CT-AP-2015 showed a significant impact in the ESLCD trend (p < 0.001). ESLCD was associated with female, white, insurance, and household incomes above median. Medicare expansion was a significant factor for insured group, married patients and those from households under the median income level. Conclusion: Medicare approval for CT screening was found to have a statistically significant effect on the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer and neither NLST-September-2011 nor CT-AP-2015-February-2015 impacted the incidence nor mortality rates. Policy summary: To improve early-stage lung cancer diagnosis, it is vital to invest in health policies to increase Lung Cancer Screening implementation and to reduce disparities in access to diagnosis. Furthermore, policies that facilitate access to diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce lung cancer mortality.","['Emmerick, I.C.M.', 'Uy, K.', 'Guiab, K.', 'Powers, M.', 'Lou, F.', 'Lin, P.', 'Maxfield, M.', 'Voland, R.', 'Varlotto, J.']",10.1016/j.jcpo.2021.100318
Racial disparities in bone metastasis patterns and targeted screening and treatment strategies in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients,"Objective: Race disparities exist in bone metastasis (BM) development and survival in lung cancer (LC) patients. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to investigate different patterns of BM development and survival in different races.Design: LC patients with BM were identified from the database from 2010 to 2014. Risk factors were investigated by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Potential factors for prognosis were evaluated by univariable and multivariable Cox regression.Results: Asian and Pacific Islander (API) patients presented the highest prevalence of BM (24.6%), followed by white (20.7%) and black patients (19.9%) (χ2 = 78.74; p < .001). After adjusting for the demographic and clinical factors, API race was independently associated with a high risk of BM development. The median survival times for the API, white and black LC patients with BM were 16 months (95% CI: 15.2-16.8), 11 months (95% CI: 10.9-11.1) and 10 months (95% CI: 9.7-10.3), respectively, with significant differences (p < .001). Multivariable Cox regression showed that API race was positively associated with greater overall survival compared with white and black patients. Male gender, larger tumor size, lymph node involvement, lower tumor differentiated grade, and the presence of lung, liver and brain metastases were independently associated with a high risk of developing BM and worse survival with LC across all races. Age, income, insurance and histological types had different impacts on BM among different races.Conclusion: Homogeneous and heterogeneous associated factors for BM were revealed among different races. Individualized screening and treatment should be performed race-specifically.","['Xu, G.', 'Cui, P.', 'Zhang, C.', 'Lin, F.', 'Xu, Y.', 'Guo, X.', 'Cai, J.', 'Baklaushev, V.P.', 'Peltzer, K.', 'Chekhonin, V.P.', 'Wang, X.', 'Wang, G.']",10.1080/13557858.2020.1734775
The characteristics of patients who quit smoking in the year following a cancer diagnosis,"PURPOSE: Continued tobacco smoking following a cancer diagnosis is associated with adverse outcomes. Our study aims to identify the demographic and clinical characteristics of survivors who quit smoking within a year of diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Measuring Your Health (MY-Health) study, a community-based survey cohort of 5506 cancer patients registered across four Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries. Using surveys completed 6-13 months after diagnosis, we identified 868 participants who reported smoking around the time of cancer diagnosis and compared their current smoking status. We employed logistic regression models to predict current smoking status, adjusting for clinical and demographic variables. RESULTS: The overall smoking cessation rate was 35% (n = 306). Survivors with non-small cell lung cancer were three times more likely to quit smoking compared to patients with non-smoking-related cancers (aOR = 3.23, 95% CI = 2.20-4.74). Participants with advanced stage cancer reported higher odds of quitting compared to those with localized cancer (aOR = 1.42, 95% CI = 1.02-1.96). Other characteristics that predicted quitting included being married, higher education level, and female sex (aOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.46-2.77; aOR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.27-2.39; aOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.11-2.13, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine smoking cessation trends in a community-based, US cancer cohort during the year after diagnosis. Survivors with lung cancer and advanced cancer were significantly more likely to quit smoking. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Practitioners may use this knowledge to target interventions and address substantial disparities in cessation rates among survivors with early stage and non-lung cancers.","['Gummerson, S.P.', 'Lowe, J.T.', 'Taylor, K.L.', 'Lobo, T.', 'Jensen, R.E.']",10.1007/s11764-021-01009-7
Social Disparities in Lung Cancer Risk and Screening,"Significant disparities exist in lung cancer incidence and screening. Geographic, racial, gender, and socioeconomic disparities affect lung cancer incidence. As the leading cause of lung cancer, smoking varies among different racioethnic groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. In addition, environmental pollutants, such as radon, industrial toxins, and air pollution, are significant risk factors for lung cancer development that is disproportionately seen in working-class communities, as well as underserved and disabled populations. Lung cancer incidence depends on diagnosis. Literature examining lung cancer incidence and screening disparities have its limitations, as most studies are methodologically limited and do not adjust for important risk factors.","['Raman, V.', 'Yong, V.', 'Erkmen, C.P.', 'Tong, B.C.']",10.1016/j.thorsurg.2021.09.011
Lung Cancer Screening by Race and Ethnicity in an Integrated Health System in Hawaii,"Importance: Racial and ethnic differences in lung cancer screening (LCS) completion and follow-up may be associated with lung cancer incidence and mortality rates among high-risk populations. Aggregation of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander racial and ethnic groups may mask the true underlying disparities in screening uptake and diagnostic follow-up, creating barriers for targeted, preventive health care. Objective: To examine racial and ethnic differences in LCS completion and follow-up rates in a multiethnic population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based cohort study was conducted at a health maintenance organization in Hawaii. LCS program participants were identified using electronic medical records from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. Study eligibility requirements included being aged 55 to 79 years, a 30 pack-year smoking history, a current smoker or having quit within the past 15 years, at least 5 years past any lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, and cancer free. Data analysis was performed from June 2019 to October 2020. Exposure: Eligible for LCS. Main Outcomes and Measures: Screening rates were analyzed by self-reported race and ethnicity and completion of a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) test. Diagnostic follow-up results were based on the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) staging system. Results: A total of 1030 eligible LCS program members had an order placed; their mean (SD) age was 65.5 (5.8) years, and 633 (61%) were men. The largest racial and ethnic groups were non-Hispanic White (381 participants [37.0%]), Native Hawaiian or part Native Hawaiian (186 participants [18.1%]), and Japanese (146 participants [14.2%]). Men and Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, and non-Hispanic White individuals had a higher proportion of screen orders for LDCT compared with women and individuals of the other racial and ethnic groups. The overall LCS completion rate was 81% (838 participants). There was a 14% to 15% screening completion rate gap among groups. Asian individuals had the highest screening completion rate (266 participants [86%]) followed by Native Hawaiian (149 participants [80%]) and non-Hispanic White individuals (305 participants [80%]), Pacific Islander (50 participants [79%]) individuals, and individuals of other racial and ethnic groups (68 participants [77%]). Within Asian subgroups, Korean (31 participants [94%]) and Japanese (129 participants [88%]) individuals had the highest completion rates followed by Chinese individuals (28 participants [82%]) and Filipino individuals (78 participants [79%]). Of the 54 participants with Lung-RADS stage 3 disease, 93% (50 participants) completed a 6-month surveillance LDCT test; of 37 individuals with Lung-RADS stage 4 disease, 35 (97%) were followed-up for additional procedures. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study found racial and ethnic disparities in LCS completion rates after disaggregation of Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian individuals and their subgroups. These findings suggest that future research is needed to understand factors that may be associated with LCS completion and follow-up behaviors among these racial and ethnic groups..","['Oshiro, C.E.S.', 'Frankland, T.B.', 'Mor, J.', 'Wong, C.P.', 'Martinez, Y.T.', 'Aruga, C.K.K.', 'Honda, S.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.44381
Randomized control trial of unconditional versus conditional incentives to increase study enrollment rates in participants at increased risk of lung cancer,"Introduction: Understanding how incentives and their timing influence study enrollment rates is important to efficient study design and increasing the generalizability of findings. This 2-arm, parallel randomized trial evaluated how conditional vs. unconditional mailed incentives of a $20 gift card affected study enrollment in a sample of participants screened for lung cancer screening. Methods: Eligible participants included Black and White adults who underwent lung cancer screening with low-dose CT and had negative screening results at two North Carolina imaging facilities in 2018. We used a stratified randomization scheme, by sex and race, to assign incentive type (conditional vs. unconditional). We used the Tailored Design Method with six points of mailed contact to engage participants. We compared study enrollment rates using chi-square tests and logistic regression analyses. Results: After adjusting for sex, race, age, smoking status, participant residence, and screening site, participants who received unconditional incentives were 74% more likely to enroll than those who received conditional incentives (adjusted OR = 1.74 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.00). Conclusions: Type of incentive can play a role in increasing study enrollment, especially mailed surveys that target individuals who currently or previously smoked. Unconditional incentives may be worth the initial cost to engage study participants.","['Kumar, A.D.', 'Durham, D.D.', 'Lane, L.', 'Perera, P.', 'Rivera, M.P.', 'Henderson, L.M.']",10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.08.027
Impact of Smoking Status on Lung Cancer Characteristics and Mortality Rates between Screened and Non-Screened Lung Cancer Cohorts: Real-World Knowledge Translation and Education,"This was a retrospective hospital-based cohort study of participants diagnosed with lung cancer in the lung cancer register database, and our goal was to evaluate the impact of smoking and screening status on lung cancer characteristics and clinical outcomes. According to the hospital-based lung cancer register database, a total of 2883 lung cancers were diagnosed in 2883 patients between January 2007 and September 2017, which were divided into four groups according to smoking and screening status. A comparison was performed in terms of clinical characteristics and outcomes of lung cancer between the four groups. For non-smokers, age, gender, screened status, tumor size, targeted therapy, and curative surgery were independent prognostic factors of overall survival for lung cancer subjects. However, screened status and gender were not significant prognostic factors for lung cancer survival in smokers with lung cancer. For the non-smoker group, about 4.9% of lung cancer subjects (N = 81) were detected by screening. However, only 0.97% of lung cancer subjects (N = 12) were detected by screening in smokers. This could be attributed to smokers’ negative attitudes and low socioeconomic status preventing LDCT lung cancer screening. In summary, our real-world data suggest that effectively encouraging smokers to be more willing to participate in lung cancer screening programs with screening allowance and educational training in the future is an important issue.","['Wu, F.-Z.', 'Wu, Y.-J.', 'Chen, C.-S.', 'Yang, S.-C.']",10.3390/jpm12010026
Addressing Sex Disparities in Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility: USPSTF vs PLCOm2012 Criteria,"Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women in the United States. Prospective randomized lung screening trials suggest a greater lung cancer mortality benefit from screening women compared with men. Research Question: Do the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) lung screening guidelines that are based solely on age and smoking history contribute to sex disparities in eligibility, and if so, does the use of the PLCOm2012 risk prediction model that is based on 11 predictors of lung cancer reduce sex disparities? Study Design and Methods: This retrospective analysis of 883 lung cancer cases in the Chicago Race Eligibility for Screening Cohort (CREST) determined the sensitivity of USPSTF vs PLCOm2012 eligibility criteria, stratified according to sex. For comparisons vs the USPSTF 2013 and the recently published USPSTF 2021 (released March 9, 2021) eligibility criteria, the PLCOm2012 model was used with risk thresholds of ≥ 1.7%/6 years (6y) and ≥ 1.0%/6y, respectively. Results: The sensitivities for screening by the USPSTF 2013 were 46.7% for women and 64.6% for men (P =.003) and by the USPSTF 2021 were 56.8% and 71.8%, respectively (P =.02). In contrast, the PLCOm2012 ≥ 1.7%/6y sensitivities were 64.6% and 70.4%, and the PLCOm2012 ≥ 1.0%/6y sensitivities were 77.4% and 82.4%. The PLCOm2012 differences in sensitivity using ≥ 1.7%/6y and ≥ 1.0%/6y thresholds between women and men were nonsignificant (both, P =.07). Compared with men, women were more likely to be ineligible according to the USPSTF 2021 criteria because their smoking exposures were < 20 pack-years (22.8% vs 14.8%; ORWomen vs Men, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.19-2.44; P =.002), and 27% of these ineligible women were eligible according to the PLCOm2012 ≥ 1.0%/6y criteria. Interpretation: Although the USPSTF 2021 eligibility criteria are more sensitive than the USPSTF 2013 guidelines, sex disparities in eligibility remain. Adding the PLCOm2012 risk prediction model to the USPSTF guidelines would improve sensitivity and attenuate sex disparities.","['Pasquinelli, M.M.', 'Tammemägi, M.C.', 'Kovitz, K.L.', 'Durham, M.L.', 'Deliu, Z.', 'Guzman, A.', 'Rygalski, K.', 'Liu, L.', 'Koshy, M.', 'Finn, P.', 'Feldman, L.E.']",10.1016/j.chest.2021.06.066
Epidemiology of lung cancer and the gender differences in risk,"Background: Lung cancer has progressed from an exceedingly rare disease to the leading cause of all cancer-related deaths, a phenomenon largely attributed to the impact of tobacco smoking and resulting global epidemic. Methods: A thorough literature search was conducted to identify relevant factors in the epidemiology of lung cancer with a focus on recent studies and developments that had the most significant impact on the current understanding of lung cancer. Results: Most recent data suggests the global burden of lung cancer is continuing to rise with 2.2 million new cases in 2020 alone. Although no difference is noted among men, a higher rate of lung cancer deaths among women in the industrialized countries are observed compared to developing nations. Incidence and deaths are closely linked to cigarette smoking. Other risk factors include occupational hazards, increasing air pollution with pulmonary infectious diseases and inflammatory conditions, and genetic factors. Tobacco continues to cause approximately 90% of all lung cancer deaths with a markedly wide variety of incidence rates both geographically and between males and females. Lung cancer incidence has been falling in US and UK since 1990 largely due to comprehensive tobacco control programs. In contrast higher rates of cigarette smoking among emerging nations is a concern. The unprecedented, widespread adoption of electronic-cigarette use among adolescents may pose major obstacles in the prevention and treatment of lung cancer. Conclusions: While the vast majority of current lung cancer cases and deaths continue to be caused by tobacco consumption, shifts in population behaviors, geographical location, and potential new causes may alter this distribution. Further work is crucial in order to better understand the risk factors for lung cancer in the modern world so that a more holistic proactive approach, rather than a reactive approach, can be taken.","['Jaradeh, M.', 'Vigneswaran, W.T.']",10.31083/j.jomh1803073
Lung Cancer Screening in Individuals with and Without Lung-Related Comorbidities,"Importance: Comorbidities characterize the underlying health status of individuals. In the context of lung cancer screening (LCS), lung-related comorbidities may influence the observed benefits and harms. Objective: To compare the characteristics of individuals undergoing LCS, the LCS examination result, the cancer detection rate (CDR), and the false-positive rate (FPR) in those with and without lung-related comorbidities. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 5 academic and community screening sites across North Carolina from January 1, 2014, to November 7, 2020. Participants included 611 individuals screened for lung cancer who completed a 1-page health history questionnaire. Exposures: Presence of at least 1 self-reported lung-related comorbidity, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, silicosis, asbestosis, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis. Main Outcomes and Measures: The LCS examination result was determined from the radiologist's Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System assessment (negative, 1 or 2; positive, 3 or 4). The age-adjusted CDR and FPR were calculated per 100 LCS examinations, using binary logistic regression. Results: Among the 611 individuals screened for lung cancer (308 men [50.4%]; mean [SD] age, 64 [6.2] years), 335 (54.8%) had at least 1 lung-related comorbidity. Individuals with vs without lung-related comorbidities were more likely to be female than male (180 of 335 [53.7%] vs 123 of 276 [44.6%]; P =.02), White vs non-White race (275 of 326 [84.4%] vs 193 of 272 [71.0%]; P <.001), and have high school or less education vs greater than a high school education (108 of 231 [46.7%] vs 64 of 208 [30.8%]; P =.001). There were no significant differences in the proportion of positive LCS examinations in those with vs without a lung-related comorbidity at baseline (37 [16.0%] vs 22 [11.1%]; P =.14) or subsequent (40 [12.3%] vs 23 [10.6%]; P =.54) LCS examination. Comparing individuals with vs without lung-related comorbidities, there was no statistically significant difference in the CDR (1.6 vs 1.9 per 100; P =.73) or FPR (13.0 vs 9.3 per 100; P =.16). Of the 17 individuals with lung cancer, 13 patients (76.5%) were diagnosed with stage I lung cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that individuals with self-reported lung-related comorbidities undergoing LCS were more likely to be female, of White race, and have less education than those without lung-related comorbidity. Although no statistically significant differences in the proportion of positive examinations, CDR, or FPR by self-reported lung comorbidities were noted, additional studies with larger numbers of individuals undergoing screening are needed to understand LCS outcomes in those with lung-related comorbidities.","['Metwally, E.M.', 'Rivera, M.P.', 'Durham, D.D.', 'Lane, L.', 'Perera, P.', 'Lamb, D.', 'Henderson, L.M.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.30146
"Impact of socioeconomic status on cancer staging, survival in non-small cell lung cancer","Purpose: We performed this study to evaluate the association of socioeconomic status (SES) factors with cancer-specific survival (CSS) of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We further assessed the predictive value of a novel Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM)-SES staging system, combining the TNM stage with the SES stage. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we selected 40,378 patients diagnosed with NSCLC from 2012 to 2016. Cox regression method and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) were performed to select the SES factors related to CSS and evaluate the predictive ability of the novel TNM-SES stage. We used Kaplan-Meier curves and a log-rank test to conduct a survival analysis. Results: We identified four SES factors (marriage, insurance, education, and household income) associated with CSS and constructed the SES stage (SES-1 and SES-2). NSCLC patients with SES-2 stage (low SES) was associated with young adult, black race, male, squamous carcinoma, upper lobe site, and advanced stage. SES-2 stage patients were significantly associated with a dismal prognosis of patients with NSCLC, with a 21.0% increased risk (HR = 1.21, 95%CI (1.18-1.24), p < 0.001). The C-index of our novel TNM-SES stage was 0.732 [95% CI (0.728-0.736)], higher than the traditional TNM stage [0.717, 95% CI (0.715-0.719)], indicating superior predictive value. Conclusion: Our population-based study indicated that SES was significantly associated with cancer staging and SCC in patients with NSCLC. Our novel TNM-SES staging system showed a superior predictive value to the traditional TNM stage. The impact of SES on patients with NSCLC should receive more concern in clinical management.","['Yang, X.', 'Deng, L.', 'Li, M.', 'Zhou, Y.', 'Wang, G.']",10.3389/fpubh.2022.992944
Neighborhood and Individual Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Survival among Patients with Nonmetastatic Common Cancers,"Importance: Disadvantaged neighborhood-level and individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) have each been associated with suboptimal cancer care and inferior outcomes. However, independent or synergistic associations between neighborhood and individual socioeconomic disadvantage have not been fully examined, and prior studies using simplistic neighborhood SES measures may not comprehensively assess multiple aspects of neighborhood SES. Objective: To investigate the associations of neighborhood SES (using a validated comprehensive composite measure) and individual SES with survival among patients with nonmetastatic common cancers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective, population-based cohort study was derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database from January 1, 2008, through December 31, 2011, with follow-up ending on December 31, 2017. Participants included older patients (≥65 years) with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer. Exposures: Neighborhood SES was measured using the area deprivation index (ADI; quintiles), a validated comprehensive composite measure of neighborhood SES. Individual SES was assessed by Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility (yes vs no), a reliable indicator for patient-level low income. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was overall mortality, and the secondary outcome was cancer-specific mortality. Hazard ratios (HRs) for the associations of ADI and dual eligibility with overall and cancer-specific mortality were estimated via Cox proportional hazards regression. Statistical analyses were conducted from January 23 to April 15, 2021. Results: A total of 96978 patients were analyzed, including 25968 with breast, 35150 with prostate, 16684 with lung, and 19176 with colorectal cancer. Median age at diagnosis was 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for breast cancer, 73 years (IQR, 70-77 years) for prostate cancer, 76 years (IQR, 71-81 years) for lung cancer, and 78 years (IQR, 72-84 years) for colorectal cancer. Among lung and colorectal cancer patients, 8412 (50.4%) and 10486 (54.7%), respectively, were female. The proportion of non-Hispanic White individuals among breast cancer patients was 83.7% (n = 21725); prostate cancer, 76.8% (n = 27001); lung cancer, 83.5% (n = 13926); and colorectal cancer, 81.1% (n = 15557). Neighborhood-level and individual-level SES were independently associated with overall mortality, and no interactions were detected. Compared with the most affluent neighborhoods (ADI quintile 1), living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI quintile 5) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26-1.43; prostate: HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.42-1.62; lung: HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.14-1.28; and colorectal: HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.32). Individual socioeconomic disadvantage (dual eligibility) was associated with higher risk of overall mortality (breast: HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.15-1.29; prostate: HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.21-1.38; lung: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20; and colorectal: HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.29). A similar pattern was observed for cancer-specific mortality. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, neighborhood-level deprivation was associated with worse survival among patients with nonmetastatic breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer, even after accounting for individual SES. These findings suggest that, in order to improve cancer outcomes and reduce health disparities, policies for ongoing investments in low-resource neighborhoods and low-income households are needed.","['Cheng, E.', 'Soulos, P.R.', 'Irwin, M.L.', 'Cespedes Feliciano, E.M.', 'Presley, C.J.', 'Fuchs, C.S.', 'Meyerhardt, J.A.', 'Gross, C.P.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.39593
Cancer Screening Among Current and Former U.S. Military Personnel Compared to Civilians: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System,"INTRODUCTION: Approximately 3% of invasive U.S. cancer diagnoses are made among veterans in a Veterans Affairs (VA) clinic each year, while VA patients only comprise about 1.9% of the U.S. population. Although some research has shown that veterans have higher incidence rates of cancer compared to civilians, evidence is sparse regarding possible disparities in rates of cancer screening between these populations. Thus, the purpose of this study is to compare differences in rates of screening for colorectal, lung, breast, and cervical cancers between current and former U.S. Military service members and civilians. METHODS: Using the data extracted from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we assessed the rates of cancer screening among current and former U.S. Military service members compared to civilians from self-reported surveys assessing when individuals had been screened for colorectal or lung cancer among all participants and breast and cervical cancer among women participants. Persons greater than 25 years of age were included in the cervical cancer screening, 50 years of age for colon cancer screening, and 40 years of age for the breast cancer screening-the latter based on recommendations from the American Cancer Society. We used multivariate logistic regression models to determine the adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) of current and former U.S. Military service members receiving screening compared to civilians, adjusting for age, gender, race, education, and health care coverage. RESULTS: Current and former U.S. Military service members accounted for 2.6% of individuals included for the cervical cancer screening analysis, 2.2% for the breast cancer screening analyses, nearly 10% of the lung cancer screening, and 15% of the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening analyses. Prevalence of screening was higher for current and former U.S. Military service members among lung cancer and CRC. When controlling for age, race, education, and health care coverage, current and former U.S. Military service members were statistically more likely to be screened for CRC (ARR: 1.05; 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.07) and lung cancer (ARR: 1.32; 95% confidence interval: 1.15-1.52). The odds of having completed a cervical or breast cancer screening were not significantly different between groups. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that current and former U.S. Military service members were more likely to complete CRC and lung cancer screenings, while no significant difference existed between each population with regard to cervical and breast cancer screenings. This is one of the few studies that have directly compared cancer screening usage among civilians and current and former U.S. Military service members. Although current and former U.S. Military service members were more likely to receive several cancer screenings, improvements can still be made to remove barriers and increase screening usage due to the disproportionate rates of cancer mortality in this population. These solutions should be comprehensive-addressing personal, organizational, and societal barriers-to improve prognosis and survival rates among current and former U.S. Military service members.","['Weygandt, J.', 'Robling, K.', 'Whitaker, L.-A.', 'McPherson, K.', 'Hartwell, M.', 'Greiner, B.']",10.1093/milmed/usab439
Incidence of suicide among adolescent and young adult cancer patients: a population-based study,"Background: As the survival rates of cancer patients continue to increase, most cancer patients now die of non-cancer causes. Several studies have been showing elevated suicide rates among patients with cancer. However, no large-scale study has thoroughly assessed the risk of suicide among adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer. This study was conducted to characterize suicide mortality among AYA patients in the US and identify risk factors associated with a higher risk of suicide. Methods: Patients aged 15–39 years were residents of the US served by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, who were diagnosed with cancers from 1973 to 2015. Results: We report that 981 of the 572,500 AYA patients with cancer committed suicide, for an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted suicide rate of 17.68/100,000 person-years. The rate of suicide was 14.33/100,000 person-years in the corresponding general population, giving a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.234 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.159–1.313]. Higher suicide rates were associated with male sex, white race, unmarried state, distant tumor stage, and single primary tumor. AYA patients with otorhinolaryngologic, gonad, stomach, soft tissue, and nasopharyngeal cancer were at the greatest risk of suicide compared with those with other types of cancer. In older patients (≥ 40 years), the risk was highest in those with lung, stomach, oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, and bone malignancies. SMRs were highest in the first 5 years after diagnosis for most types of cancer. Conclusion: AYA patients with cancer in the US have over 20% higher the incidence of suicide of the general population, and most suicides occurred in the first 5 years following diagnosis. Suicide rates vary among patients with cancers of different anatomic sites. Further examination of the psychological experience of these young patients with cancer, particularly that of those with certain types of cancer, is warranted.","['Yang, P.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Hou, X.']",10.1186/s12935-021-02225-y
"Global, regional, and national cancer incidence and death for 29 cancer groups in 2019 and trends analysis of the global cancer burden, 1990–2019","Background and aims: Cancer will soon become the leading cause of death in every country in the twenty-first century. This study aimed to analyze the mortality and morbidity of 29 types of cancer in 204 countries or regions from 1990 to 2019 to guide global cancer prevention and control. Methods: Detailed information for 29 cancer groups was collected from the Global Burden of Disease Study in 2019. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of the 29 cancer groups were calculated based on sex, age, region, and country. In addition, separate analyses were performed for major cancer types. Results: In 2019, more than 10 million people died from cancer, which was approximately twice the number in 1990. Tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancers collectively showed the highest death rate, and the ASDR of pancreatic cancer increased by 24%, which was cancer with the highest case fatality rate (CFR). The global cancer ASIR showed an increasing trend, with testicular cancer, thyroid cancer, and malignant skin melanoma showing a significant increase. The ASDR and ASIR of cancer in males were about 1.5 times higher than that in females. Individuals over 50 years had the highest risk of developing cancer, with incidences and deaths in this age group accounting for more than 85% of cancers in all age groups. Asia has the heaviest cancer burden due to its high population density, with esophageal cancer in this region accounting for 53% of the total fatalities related to this type of cancer in the world. In addition, the mortality and morbidity of most cancers increased with the increase in the development or socio-demographic index (SDI) in the SDI regions based on the World Bank's Human Development Index (HDI), with cancer characteristics varying in the different countries globally. Conclusions: The global cancer burden continues to increase, with substantial mortality and morbidity differences among the different regions, ages, countries, gender, and cancer types. Effective and locally tailored cancer prevention and control measures are essential in reducing the global cancer burden in the future.","['Lin, L.', 'Li, Z.', 'Yan, L.', 'Liu, Y.', 'Yang, H.', 'Li, H.']",10.1186/s13045-021-01213-z
"Disparities in stage at diagnosis for five common cancers in China: a multicentre, hospital-based, observational study","Background: Stage information is crucial for cancer care and essential to improve polices for cancer control. However, the distribution of stage at diagnosis for common cancers in China is not well known. We aimed to identify the distribution and factors associated with stage at diagnosis for five major cancers in China. Methods: In this multicentre, hospital-based, observational study, we included 23 hospitals in 12 provinces from China. We focused on cancers of the lung, stomach, oesophagus, colorectum, and female breast, and using electronic medical records at the individual level from the local hospitals, and cancer registration records from population-based cancer registries, identified diagnoses made between Jan 1, 2016, and Dec 31, 2017. We collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, insurance types, and stage at diagnosis. We analysed the prevalence of late-stage (stages III–IV) cancer cases overall, by sex, and by geographical region. We used logistic regression to identify the factors that were associated with late stage at diagnosis. We further compared these estimates with data from the USA using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Findings: We included 52 103 eligible patients. Among 41 671 patients with known stage at diagnosis, 22 009 (52·8%) were diagnosed with late-stage cancer. The proportion of late-stage cases was higher in men and boys than in women and girls (14 084 [64·1%] of 21 973 vs 7925 [40·2%] of 19 698 patients; diagnosed at stages III–IV; adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1·3, 95% CI 1·2–1·5). There is a persistent diagnostic disparity between rural and urban areas (adjusted OR 1·2, 1·1–1·4). Patients with the new rural cooperative medical scheme insurance had a significantly higher risk of late-stage diagnosis compared with patients with urban insurance (adjusted OR 1·4, 1·1–1·9). By specific cancer type, sex and rural–urban disparities were the largest in lung cancer. Compared with the USA, our study patients had a higher percentage of stage II–IV breast cancer (72·4% in China vs 48·8% in the USA), lung cancer (82·7% in China vs 74·7% in the USA), and colorectal cancer (84·8% in China vs 75·9% in the USA). Interpretation: The disparities of cancer diagnosis within China, and between China and the USA, indicate an urgent need for early detection of cancer in China.

"Prediction of overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer with bone metastasis: an analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database","Background: The prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with bone metastasis is extremely repulsive. The aim of this study was to potentially characterize the prevalence, associated factors and to establish a prognostic nomogram to predict the overall survival (OS) of NSCLC patients with bone metastasis. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was used to collected NSCLC cases during 2010–2015. The cases with incomplete clinicopathological information were excluded. Finally, 484 NSCLC patients with bone metastasis were included in the present study and randomly divided into the training (n=340) and validation (n=144) cohorts in a ratio of 7:3 based on R software. NSCLC patients with bone metastasis were selected to investigate predictive factors for OS and cancer-specific survival (CSS) using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. A nomogram incorporating these prognostic factors was developed and evaluated by a concordance index (C-index), calibration plots, and risk group stratifications. Results: In the Cox proportional hazards model, sex, race, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) N, T stage, liver metastasis, and chemotherapy were regarded as prognostic factors of OS. The nomogram based on sex, race, AJCC N, T stage, liver metastasis and chemotherapy was developed for cancer-specific death to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rate with good performance. The C-index of established nomogram was 0.695 for cancer-specific death in the study population with an acceptable calibration. Conclusions: The female gender, the patients with chemotherapy and not liver metastasis may indicate improved survival. However, the global prospective data with the latest tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classification is needed to further improve this model.","['Shi, S.', 'Wang, H.', 'Liu, X.', 'Xiao, J.']",10.21037/tcr-21-1507
Treatment Outcomes and Safety of Mobocertinib in Platinum-Pretreated Patients with EGFR Exon 20 Insertion-Positive Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Phase 1/2 Open-label Nonrandomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) with EGFR exon 20 insertion (EGFRex20ins) mutations is associated with a poor prognosis. Mobocertinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor designed to selectively target EGFRex20ins mutations. Objective: To evaluate treatment outcomes and safety of mobocertinib in patients with previously treated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 3-part, open-label, phase 1/2 nonrandomized clinical trial with dose-escalation/dose-expansion cohorts (28 sites in the US) and a single-arm extension cohort (EXCLAIM; 40 sites in Asia, Europe, and North America) was conducted between June 2016 and November 2020 (data cutoff date). The primary analysis populations were the platinum-pretreated patients (PPP) cohort and the EXCLAIM cohort. The PPP cohort included 114 patients with platinum-pretreated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC who received mobocertinib 160 mg once daily from the dose-escalation (n = 6), dose-expansion (n = 22), and EXCLAIM (n = 86) cohorts. The EXCLAIM cohort included 96 patients with previously treated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC (10 were not platinum pretreated and thus were excluded from the PPP cohort). Interventions: Mobocertinib 160 mg once daily. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point of the PPP and EXCLAIM cohorts was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) assessed by independent review committee (IRC). Secondary end points included confirmed ORR by investigator, duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. Results: Among the PPP (n = 114) and EXCLAIM (n = 96) cohorts, the median (range) age was 60 (27-84) and 59 (27-80) years, respectively; most patients were women (75 [66%] and 62 [65%], respectively) and of Asian race (68 [60%] and 66 [69%], respectively). At data cutoff, median follow-up was 14.2 months in the PPP cohort (median 2 prior anticancer regimens; 40 [35%] had baseline brain metastases), with confirmed ORR of 28% (95% CI, 20%-37%) by IRC assessment and 35% (95% CI, 26%-45%) by investigator assessment; median duration of response by IRC assessment was 17.5 months (95% CI, 7.4-20.3). Median progression-free survival by IRC assessment was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.5-9.2). Median overall survival was 24.0 months (95% CI, 14.6-28.8). In the EXCLAIM cohort, median follow-up was 13.0 months, with confirmed ORR by IRC assessment of 25% (95% CI, 17%-35%) and by investigator assessment of 32% (95% CI, 23%-43%). The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea and rash. Conclusions and Relevance: In this open-label, phase 1/2 nonrandomized clinical trial, mobocertinib was associated with clinically meaningful benefit in patients with previously treated EGFRex20ins-positive mNSCLC, with a manageable safety profile.

"The use of in-hospital medical care for patients with metastasized colon, bronchus, or lung cancer","Purpose: At the end of life, patients and their families tend to favor adequate pain and symptom management and attention to comfort measures over prolongation of life. However, it has been suggested that many cancer patients without curative options still receive aggressive treatment. We therefore aimed to describe the number of diagnostic procedures, hospitalization, and medication use among these patients as well as factors associated with receiving such care. Methods: We conducted a cohort study on all patients with metastasized cancer from a primary colon or bronchus and lung (BL) neoplasm from the moment of first admittance (January–December 2017) to end of follow-up (November 2018) or death. Results: A total of 408 patients with colon (36%) or BL (64%) cancer were included in this study, with a median survival time of 7.4 months. 93% of the patients were subjected to at least one diagnostic procedure, 49% received chemotherapy, and 56% received expensive medication including immunotherapy. Patients had a median of 4.6 hospital admissions and 2.3 emergency room (ER) visits. A quarter of all patients (n = 105) received specialized palliative care with a mean of 1.96 consultations and the first consultation after a median time of 4.1 months. Patients with BL neoplasms received significantly more diagnostic procedures, chemotherapy episodes, ER/ICU admissions, and more often received an end-of-life statement per person-year than patients with a primary colon neoplasm. Females received significantly less diagnostic procedures and visited the ER/ICU less frequently than males, and patients aged > 70 years received significantly less chemotherapy (episodes) and expensive medication than younger patients. No differences in care were found between different socioeconomic status groups. Conclusion: Patients with metastasized colon or BL cancer receive a large amount of in-hospital medical care. Specialized palliative care was initiated relatively late despite the incurable disease status of all patients. Factors associated with more procedures were BL neoplasms, age between 50 and 70, and male gender.","['van Brakel, I.S.L.', 'Stuiver, M.M.', 'Euser, S.M.', 'de Klerk, G.J.', 'van Stralen, K.J.']",10.1007/s00520-021-06233-6
"Description of a Lung Cancer Hotspot: Disparities in Lung Cancer Histology, Incidence, and Survival in Kentucky and Appalachian Kentucky","Introduction: Kentucky is recognized as the state with the highest lung cancer burden for more than 2 decades, but how lung cancer differs in Kentucky relative to other US populations is not fully understood. Patients and Methods: We examined lung cancer reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program by Kentucky and the other SEER regions for patients diagnosed between 2012 and 2016. Our analyses included histologic types, incidence rates, stage at diagnosis, and survival in Kentucky and Appalachian Kentucky relative to other SEER regions. Results: We found that both squamous cell carcinomas and small-cell lung cancers represent larger proportions of lung cancer diagnoses in Kentucky and Appalachian Kentucky than they do in the SEER registries. Furthermore, age-adjusted cancer incidence rates were higher in Kentucky for every subtype of lung cancer examined. Most notably, for Appalachian women the rate of small-cell carcinomas was 3.5-fold higher, and for Appalachian men the rate of squamous cell carcinoma was 3.1-fold higher, than the SEER rates. In Kentucky, lung cancers were diagnosed at later stages and lung cancer survival was lower for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine carcinomas than in SEER registries. Squamous cell carcinomas and small-cell carcinomas were most lethal in Appalachian Kentucky. Conclusion: Together, these data highlight the considerable disparities among lung cancer cases in the United States and demonstrate the continuing high burden and poor survival of lung cancer in Kentucky and Appalachian Kentucky. Strategies to identify and rectify causes of these disparities are discussed.","['Brainson, C.F.', 'Huang, B.', 'Chen, Q.', 'McLouth, L.E.', 'He, C.', 'Hao, Z.', 'Arnold, S.M.', 'Zinner, R.G.', 'Mullett, T.W.', 'Bocklage, T.J.', 'Orren, D.K.', 'Villano, J.L.', 'Durbin, E.B.']",10.1016/j.cllc.2021.03.007
High-Ambient Air Pollution Exposure Among Never Smokers Versus Ever Smokers With Lung Cancer,"Introduction: Air pollution may play an important role in the development of lung cancer in people who have never smoked, especially among East Asian women. The aim of this study was to compare cumulative ambient air pollution exposure between ever and never smokers with lung cancer. Methods: A consecutive case series of never and ever smokers with newly diagnosed lung cancer were compared regarding their sex, race, and outdoor and household air pollution exposure. Using individual residential history, cumulative exposure to outdoor particulate matter (PM2.5) in a period of 20 years was quantified with a high-spatial resolution global exposure model. Results: Of the 1005 patients with lung cancer, 56% were females and 33% were never smokers. Compared with ever smokers with lung cancer, never smokers with lung cancer were significantly younger, more frequently Asian, less likely to have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or a family history of lung cancer, and had higher exposure to outdoor PM2.5 but lower exposure to secondhand smoke. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association with never-smoking patients with lung cancer and being female (OR = 4.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.76–5.82, p < 0.001), being Asian (ORAsian versus non-Asian = 6.48, 95% CI: 4.42–9.50, p < 0.001), and having greater exposure to air pollution (ORln_PM2.5 = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.10–7.2.90, p = 0.019). Conclusions: Compared with ever-smoking patients with lung cancer, never-smoking patients had strong associations with being female, being Asian, and having air pollution exposures. Our results suggest that incorporation of cumulative exposure to ambient air pollutants be considered when assessing lung cancer risk in combination with traditional risk factors.","['Myers, R.', 'Brauer, M.', 'Dummer, T.', 'Atkar-Khattra, S.', 'Yee, J.', 'Melosky, B.', 'Ho, C.', 'McGuire, A.L.', 'Sun, S.', 'Grant, K.', 'Lee, A.', 'Lee, M.', 'Yuchi, W.', 'Tammemagi, M.', 'Lam, S.']",10.1016/j.jtho.2021.06.015
Gender differences and immunotherapy outcome in advanced lung cancer,"In developed countries, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in both sexes. Although cigarette smoking represents the principal risk factor for lung cancer in females, the higher proportion of this neoplasm among non-smoking women as compared with non-smoking men implies distinctive biological aspects between the two sexes. Gender differences depend not only on genetic, environmental, and hormonal factors but also on the immune system, and all these aspects are closely interconnected. In the last few years, it has been confirmed that the immune system plays a fundamental role in cancer evolution and response to oncological treatments, specifically immunotherapy, with documented distinctions between men and women. Consequently, in order to correctly assess cancer responses and disease control, considering only age and reproductive status, the results of studies conducted in female patients would probably not categorically apply to male patients and vice versa. The aim of this article is to review recent data about gender disparities in both healthy subjects’ immune system and lung cancer patients; furthermore, studies concerning gender differences in response to lung cancer immunotherapy are examined.","['Vavalà, T.', 'Catino, A.', 'Pizzutilo, P.', 'Longo, V.', 'Galetta, D.']",10.3390/ijms222111942
Ventilation in patients with stage IIIB or above lung cancer,"Background: To investigate the distribution of lung function and ventilation dysfunction in patients with locally advanced and advanced lung cancer, and the correlation with clinical factors. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on patients who were discharged from the respiratory department of our hospital and diagnosed with locally advanced (IIIB, IIIC) or advanced (IVA, IVB) lung cancer from October 2013 to October 2020. Demographic information, clinical data, and lung function assessments were recorded, and the proportion and type of ventilation dysfunction and the correlations between them and clinical factors were statistically analyzed. Results: A total of 130 patients were included. Han nationality accounted for 99.2%, and males accounted for 79.2% of patients. The average age was 68.48±10.77 years old. In terms of the stage of lung cancer, the proportion of locally advanced IIIB/IIIC was 34.6%, and the proportion of advanced IVA/IVB was 65.4%. The lung function results were as follows: Forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) was 72.27% (62.35%, 79.60%), FEV1/vital capacity (VC) was 71.35% (61.78%, 79.20%), FEV1 was 1.72±0.64 L, VC was 2.44±0.70 L, and total lung volume (TLC) was 4.41±0.97 L. Obstructive, restrictive, and mixed ventilation dysfunction accounted for 23.1%, 26.9%, 27.7%, respectively, and 93.1% had not received lung function screening or treatment before. A total of 42 cases (32.3%) had moderate or above obstruction or mixed (mainly obstruction) ventilation dysfunction. The most common symptoms were cough (88.1%), expectoration (71.4%), and dyspnea (40.5%). The chi-square test showed that male, ≥70 years old, smoking history, smoking index ≥800 years, accompanied by airway diseases [chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/asthma/chronic bronchitis], and computed tomography (CT) with atelectasis accounted for a higher proportion (P<0.05). Logistic regression showed that age (P=0.003), smoking history (P=0.04), atelectasis (P=0.004), and associated airway diseases (P=0.001) were significant related factors. Conclusions: Some patients with locally advanced or advanced lung cancer have ventilation dysfunction, especially moderate or above obstruction or mixed (mainly obstruction) ventilation dysfunction. For vulnerable populations such as males, the elderly, long-term heavy smokers, patients with airway diseases, or patients with atelectasis on CT, lung function assessment and intervention should be improved to further manage the symptom control and quality of life of patients with this type of lung cancer.","['Zhang, H.', 'Ni, J.', 'Cheng, Q.']",10.21037/atm-21-2203
Intersection of social vulnerability and residential diversity: Postoperative outcomes following resection of lung and colon cancer,"Introduction: While the impact of demographic factors on postoperative outcomes has been examined, little is known about the intersection between social vulnerability and residential diversity on postoperative outcomes following cancer surgery. Methods: Individuals who underwent a lung or colon resection for cancer were identified in the 2016–2017 Medicare database. Data were merged with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention social vulnerability index and a residential diversity index was calculated. Logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the probability of postoperative outcomes. Results: Among 55 742 Medicare beneficiaries who underwent lung (39.4%) or colon (60.6%) resection, most were male (46.6%), White (90.2%) and had a mean age of 75.3 years. After adjustment for competing risk factors, both social vulnerability and residential diversity were associated with mortality and other postoperative outcomes. In assessing the intersection of social vulnerability and residential diversity, synergistic effects were noted as patients from counties with low social vulnerability and high residential diversity had the lowest probability of 30-day mortality (3.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0–3.5) while patients from counties with high social vulnerability and low diversity had a higher probability of 30-day postoperative death (5.2%, 95% CI: 4.6–5.8; odds ratio: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.03). Conclusion: Social vulnerability and residential diversity were independently associated with postoperative outcomes. The intersection of these two social health determinants demonstrated a synergistic effect on the risk of adverse outcomes following lung and colon cancer surgery.","['Diaz, A.', 'Dalmacy, D.', 'Hyer, J.M.', 'Tsilimigras, D.', 'Pawlik, T.M.']",10.1002/jso.26588
Socioeconomic Disparities in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer With Brain Metastases at Presentation: A Population-Based Study,"Objective/Background: The purpose of this study was to characterize the impact of household income disparities in the survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with brain metastasis on a population-based level. Methods: This is a population-based cohort study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2010–2016 including 15,808 NSCLC patients presenting with brain metastasis. Results: This study comprises 15,808 adult patients with NSCLC presenting with brain metastases having an age range 64 ± 10 years with 51% male, 76% white, 52% married, 61% insured, and with 85% of lung adenocarcinoma histopathology. The 1-, 2- and 5-year survival rates for living in the lower household income quartile were 21%, 10%, and 3%, respectively, for the second quartile 24%, 10%, and 3%; for the third quartile 28%, 14%, and 4%; and for the top quartile 31%, 17%, and 4%, respectively. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that living in a higher quartile household income county is associated with increased survival (P < 0.0001), hazard ratio 0.87, 95% confidence interval (0.82–0.92). Conclusions: This population-based study suggests that living in higher median household income counties is associated with increased survival time and reduced risk of mortality for patients with NSCLC who have brain metastases present at diagnosis, independent of other factors. These findings underscore the importance of ensuring adequate and easy access to care for all patients, irrespective of their economic background.","['Jusue-Torres, I.', 'Hulbert, A.', 'Zakaria, J.', 'Albain, K.S.', 'Hentz, C.L.', 'Melian, E.', 'Thakkar, J.P.', 'Prabhu, V.C.']",10.1016/j.wneu.2021.07.024
The trajectory of racial/ethnic disparities in the use of cancer screening before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: A large U.S. academic center analysis,"Cancer screening rates declined sharply early in the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of the pandemic may have exacerbated existing disparities in cancer screening due to the disproportionate burden of illness and job loss among racial/ ethnic minorities, and potentially, uneven resumption of care between different racial/ ethnic groups. Using electronic health record data from Mass General Brigham (MGB), we assessed changes in rates of breast, cervical, colorectal and lung cancer screening before and during the pandemic. Among patients who received primary care in an MGB-affiliated primary care practice, cancer screening rates were calculated as the number of individuals who received a screening test for each cancer type over the number of individuals due for each test, during each month between April 2019-November 2020. We conducted an interrupted time-series analysis to test for changes in screening rates by race/ethnicity before and during the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, relative to White individuals, Asian women were less likely to receive breast cancer screening (p < 0.001), and Latinx and Black individuals were less likely to screen for lung cancer (p < 0.001 and p = 0.02). Our results did not show significant improvement or worsening of racial/ethnic disparities for any cancer screening type as screening resumed. However, as of November 2020 rates of screening for breast cancer were lower than pre-pandemic levels for Latinx individuals, and lung cancer screening rates were higher than baseline for Latinx, Black or White individuals. Further monitoring of disparities in cancer screening is warranted as the pandemic evolves.","['Marcondes, F.O.', 'Cheng, D.', 'Warner, E.T.', 'Kamran, S.C.', 'Haas, J.S.']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106640
Significant Regional Differences in Lung Cancer Incidence in Hungary: Epidemiological Study Between 2011 and 2016,"Objective: Hungary has one of the highest incidences and mortality rates of lung cancer (LC), therefore the objective of this study was to analyse and compare LC incidence and mortality rates between the main Hungarian regions. Methods: This nationwide, retrospective study used data from the National Health Insurance Fund and included patients aged ≥20 years who were diagnosed with lung cancer (ICD-10 C34) between Jan 1, 2011 and Dec 31, 2016. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated and compared for the main regions. Results: The highest incidence rate in males was recorded in Northern Hungary (146.8/100,000 person-years [PY]), while the lowest rate was found in Western Transdanubia (94.7/100,000 PY in 2011). All rates showed a declining trend between 2011 and 2016, with the largest decrease in the Northern Great Plain (−20.0%; p = 0.008). LC incidence and mortality rates in women both showed a rising tendency in all regions of Hungary, reaching the highest in Central Hungary (59.86/100,000 PY in 2016). Lung cancer incidence and mortality rates in males correlated with the level of education and smoking prevalence (p = 0.006 and p = 0.01, respectively) in the regions. A correlation with GDP per capita and Health Development Index (HDI) index could also be observed in the Hungarian regions, although these associations were not statistically significant. No correlations could be detected between these parameters among females. Conclusion: This analysis revealed considerable differences in the epidemiology of LC between the 7 main Hungarian regions. LC incidence and mortality rates significantly correlated with smoking and certain socioeconomic factors in men, but not in women. Further research is needed to explain the regional differences.","['Gálffy, G.', 'Vastag, A.', 'Bogos, K.', 'Kiss, Z.', 'Ostoros, G.', 'Müller, V.', 'Urbán, L.', 'Bittner, N.', 'Sárosi, V.', 'Polányi, Z.', 'Nagy-Erdei, Z.', 'Daniel, A.', 'Knollmajer, K.', 'Várnai, M.', 'Szegner, P.', 'Vokó, Z.', 'Nagy, B.', 'Horváth, K.', 'Rokszin, G.', 'Abonyi-Tóth, Z.', 'Pozsgai, É.', 'Barcza, Z.', 'Moldvay, J.', 'Tamási, L.']",10.3389/pore.2021.1609916
Sex-based heterogeneity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs): A narrative review,"Objective: The aim of our review is to analyse sex-based differences in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) patients in terms of clinical-pathological and molecular features, focusing on their impact on immune response and outcome. Background: Lung cancer (LC) remains the leading cause of cancer mortality both in men and women worldwide. In the era of precision oncology, the idea of unleashing the host immune system against cancer through the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) radically shaped the therapeutic approach in the setting of non-oncogene addicted aNSCLC. Despite durable remissions and prolonged survival in a subset of patients, potential markers for individual prediction of immunotherapy effectiveness lacked high sensitivity and specificity. The selection of patients who could most benefit from single ICIs remains an unmet need, as well as the improvement of combination strategies for those one unresponsive or refractory to immunotherapy. Sex is a known variable that affects both innate and adaptive immune responses, as well as possibly clinical-pathological and molecular basis of LC. Although smoking is the primary risk factor for LC development in both men and women, other variable such as genetic differences, sex hormones, environmental exposures and lifestyle habit, immune system and tumor microenvironment (TME) disparities, could play an important role in sex-biased carcinogenesis and development of immune responses. Methods: An extended review of literature through PubMed was conducted, using the keywords related to patient sex (“sex”, “gender”, “male/female”, “men/women”) and NSCLC and LC epidemiological, etiological, clinical-pathological and molecular features. Conclusions: Women vs. men differences in terms of response to ICIs remain to date only suggestive, so further research, including prospective clinical trials, is warranted to establish sex as a factor in the therapeutic decision-making process.","['Frega, S.', 'Ferro, A.', 'Bonanno, L.', 'Guarneri, V.', 'Conte, P.', 'Pasello, G.']",10.21037/PCM-21-7
"Integrating electronic health record, cancer registry, and geospatial data to study lung cancer in Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander ethnic groups","Background: A relatively high proportion of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) females with lung cancer have never smoked. We used an integrative data approach to assemble a large-scale cohort to study lung cancer risk among AANHPIs by smoking status with attention to representation of specific AANHPI ethnic groups. Methods: We leveraged electronic health records (EHRs) from two healthcare systems—Sutter Health in northern California and Kaiser Permanente Hawai’i—that have high representation of AANHPI populations. We linked EHR data on lung cancer risk factors (i.e., smoking, lung diseases, infections, reproductive factors, and body size) to data on incident lung cancer diagnoses from statewide population-based cancer registries of California and Hawai’i for the period between 2000 and 2013. Geocoded address data were linked to data on neighborhood contextual factors and regional air pollutants. Results: The dataset comprises over 2.2 million adult females and males of any race/ethnicity. Over 250,000 are AANHPI females (19.6% of the female study population). Smoking status is available for over 95% of individuals. The dataset includes 7,274 lung cancer cases, including 613 cases among AANHPI females. Prevalence of never-smoking status varied greatly among AANHPI females with incident lung cancer, from 85.7% among Asian Indian to 14.4% among Native Hawaiian females. Conclusion: We have developed a large, multilevel dataset particularly well-suited to conduct prospective studies of lung cancer risk among AANHPI females who never smoked. Impact: The integrative data approach is an effective way to conduct cancer research assessing multilevel factors on cancer outcomes among small populations.","['DeRouen, M.C.', 'Thompson, C.A.', 'Canchola, A.J.', 'Jin, A.', 'Nie, S.', 'Wong, C.', 'Jain, J.', 'Lichtensztajn, D.Y.', 'Li, Y.', 'Allen, L.', 'Patel, M.I.', 'Daida, Y.G.', 'Luft, H.S.', 'Shariff-Marco, S.', 'Reynolds, P.', 'Wakelee, H.A.', 'Liang, S.-Y.', 'Waitzfelder, B.E.', 'Cheng, I.', 'Gomez, S.L.']",10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-21-0019

"Surgical choice for patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer ≤2 cm: an analysis from surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database","BACKGROUND: No consensus was reached on the surgical procedure for patients with stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ≤ 2 cm. The aim of this study is to investigate the appropriate surgical procedure for stage I NSCLC ≤2 cm. METHODS: Patients with stage I NSCLC ≤2 cm received wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy between January 2004 and December 2015 were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Data were stratified by age, gender, race, side, location, grade, histology, extent of lymphadenectomy. Overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) were compared among patients received wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy. Univariate analysis and multivariable Cox regression were performed to identify the prognostic factors of OS and LCSS. RESULTS: A total of 16,511 patients with stage I NSCLC ≤2 cm were included in this study, of whom 2945 patients were classified as stage I NSCLC ≤1 cm. Lobectomy had better OS and LCSS when compared with wedge resection in patients with NSCLC ≤2 cm. Only OS favored lobectomy compared with segmentectomy in stage I NSCLC>1 to 2 cm. Multivariable analysis showed that segmentectomy had similar OS and LCSS compared with lobectomy in patients with stage I NSCLC ≤2 cm. Lymph node dissection (LND) was associated with better OS in patients with NSCLC ≤2 cm and better LCSS in patients with stage I NSCLC>1 to 2 cm. CONCLUSIONS: Segmentectomy showed comparable survival compared with lobectomy in patients with stage I NSCLC ≤2 cm. LND can provide more accurate pathological stage, may affect survival, and should be recommended for above patients.","['Wu, L.', 'Zhao, W.', 'Chen, T.', 'Yang, Y.']",10.1186/s13019-021-01568-x
Treatment and outcomes for indigenous and non-indigenous lung cancer patients in the Top End of the Northern Territory,"Background: Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and the death rate of lung cancer in Indigenous Australians is increasing. Aims: To provide a comprehensive description of patterns of lung cancer presentation, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes in Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians in the Top End of the Northern Territory. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients with a new diagnosis of lung cancer in the Top End between January 2010 and December 2014. Unadjusted survival probabilities by indigenous status were calculated. The primary end-point was all-cause mortality. Results: Despite receiving similar diagnostic procedures and treatment, Indigenous Australians with lung cancer have poorer 1- and 5-year survival (25.0% and 9.4% respectively), when compared to non-Indigenous Australians included in the study (42.0% and 16.2% respectively). Indigenous lung cancer patients were more likely to be female (51.6% of indigenous patients were female, compared to 30.5% non-indigenous), be current smokers (61.3% vs 36.9%), have more comorbidities (73.6% vs 52.7%, 24.2% vs 5.3% and 30.8% vs 14.2% for respiratory disease, renal insufficiency and diabetes mellitus respectively), and live in more socio-economically disadvantaged (66.7% vs 14.2%) and very remote areas (66.1% vs 6.8%). They were also more likely to die at home, compared to their non-indigenous counterparts (64.3% vs 26.7%). Conclusions: Indigenous patients from the Top End diagnosed with lung cancer were more likely to have poorer survival outcomes when compared to non-indigenous people. Potential reasons for the discrepancy in survival need to be addressed urgently.","['Basnayake, T.L.', 'Valery, P.C.', 'Carson, P.', 'De Ieso, P.B.']",10.1111/imj.14961
Clinical Experience with 75-mg Dose of Erlotinib for Mutated Metastatic EGFR Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"Background:Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, although important advances in target therapy have been developed in the past few years. Erlotinib is a reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, which was approved at its maximum tolerated dose of 150 mg/d determined from the initial phase I study. Studies suggest that the optimal biological dose of erlotinib should be lower and dependent on different variables.Study Question:We aimed to evaluate the response rates and toxicity with 75 mg/d dose of erlotinib in South American patients.Method:We performed a retrospective review of 18 patients with histologically proven (+) EGFR (+) mutation metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) treated with 75 mg/d erlotinib as starting dose.Measures and Outcomes:Clinical information, including toxicity grade 1-4, drug discontinuation, clinical evolution and radiological evaluation, and overall survival (OS), was revised.Results:Patients received 75 mg/d of erlotinib as starting dose. Sixteen (89%) patients were treated in first-line treatment and 2 (11%) in second-line treatment. Mean age was 62 years (range 36-89 years), and 50% patients were female. Sixteen percent of the patients had brain metastases at first diagnosis. All patients had mutation positive EGFR, 12 (66%) had Del19 and 6 (34%) exon 21 mutation. Median progression-free survival was 17 months and OS 23 months. The main grade 1-2 toxicities were rash (44%) and diarrhea (22%). No grade 3-4 toxicity and no cases of drug discontinuation were reported.Conclusions:In South American population with mutated mNSCLC, a dose of 75 mg/d of erlotinib was well tolerated. This dose resulted in comparable benefits in progression-free survival and OS when compared to those reported in the literature with the standard dose. More studies are needed to explore the use of adjusted doses of biological agents in different ethnic backgrounds.","['Aren, O.', 'Samtani, S.', 'Frelinghuysen, M.', 'Burotto, M.']",10.1097/MJT.0000000000001074
Patterns of age disparities in colon and lung cancer survival: A systematic narrative literature review,"Objectives To identify patterns of age disparities in cancer survival, using colon and lung cancer as exemplars. Design Systematic review of the literature. Data sources We searched Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science through 18 December 2020. Eligibility criteria We retained all original articles published in English including patients with colon or lung cancer. Eligible studies were required to be population-based, report survival across several age groups (of which at least one was over the age of 65) and at least one other characteristic (eg, sex, treatment). Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies against selected evaluation domains from the QUIPS tool, and items concerning statistical reporting. We evaluated age disparities using the absolute difference in survival or mortality rates between the middle-aged group and the oldest age group, or by describing survival curves. Results Out of 3047 references, we retained 59 studies (20 for colon, 34 for lung and 5 for both sites). Regardless of the cancer site, the included studies were highly heterogeneous and often of poor quality. The magnitude of age disparities in survival varied greatly by sex, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, stage at diagnosis, cancer site, and morphology, the number of nodes examined and treatment strategy. Although results were inconsistent for most characteristics, we consistently observed greater age disparities for women with lung cancer compared with men. Also, age disparities increased with more advanced stages for colon cancer and decreased with more advanced stages for lung cancer. Conclusions Although age is one of the most important prognostic factors in cancer survival, age disparities in colon and lung cancer survival have so far been understudied in population-based research. Further studies are needed to better understand age disparities in colon and lung cancer survival.

The molecular basis of gender disparities in smoking lung cancer patients,"Aims: Gender disparities exist in smoking-related lung cancer epidemiology, but the molecular basis has not been explored so far. We aimed at identifying genes with gender-bias expression pattern in smoking lung cancer patients for understanding the molecular basis of gender bias in smokers using meta-analysis of microarray gene expression data. Materials and methods: Transcriptome of around 1100 samples from 13 studies were used in the meta-analysis to identify ‘Lung Cancer genes specific to Female-Smokers’ (LCFS) and ‘Lung Cancer genes specific to Male-Smokers’ (LCMS). The expression profiles of these genes were validated with an independent microarray report and TCGA-RNA-sequencing data. The molecular interactions, pathway, and other functional annotations were portrayed for the key genes identified. Key findings: We identified 1159 gender-biased genes in smoking lung cancer patients. Of these, 400 and 474 genes showed differential expression in cancerous compared to normal lung of women (LCFS) and men (LCMS), respectively. While many up-regulated LCFS were involved in ‘immune responses’ including T-cell activation, leukocyte cell-cell adhesion, the LCMS were mainly involved in ‘positive regulation of gene expression’, signaling pathways including RAS, VEGF, insulin-receptor signaling, and ‘cell cycle’. Significance: The strategic-method identified genes, particularly, SNX20, GIMAP6, MTMR2, FAM171B, IDH1, MOBP, FBXO17, LPXN and WIPF1, which were consistently differentially expressed in at least 4 studies, and in agreement with RNA-Seq data. Exploring their functions could be beneficial to the gender-based diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of lung cancer in smokers. The current meta-analysis supports existing knowledge of sexual-dimorphism of immune responses in cancer.","['Davuluri, S.', 'Bajpai, A.K.', 'Thirumurugan, K.', 'Acharya, K.K.']",10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118927
"The relationship between body-mass index and overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer by sex, smoking status, and race: A pooled analysis of 20,937 International lung Cancer consortium (ILCCO) patients","Introduction: The relationship between Body-Mass-Index (BMI) and lung cancer prognosis is heterogeneous. We evaluated the impact of sex, smoking and race on the relationship between BMI and overall survival (OS) in non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Data from 16 individual ILCCO studies were pooled to assess interactions between BMI and the following factors on OS: self-reported race, smoking status and sex, using Cox models (adjusted hazard ratios; aHR) with interaction terms and adjusted penalized smoothing spline plots in stratified analyses. Results: Among 20,937 NSCLC patients with BMI values, females = 47 %; never-smokers = 14 %; White-patients = 76 %. BMI showed differential survival according to race whereby compared to normal-BMI patients, being underweight was associated with poor survival among white patients (OS, aHR = 1.66) but not among black patients (aHR = 1.06; pinteraction = 0.02). Comparing overweight/obese to normal weight patients, Black NSCLC patients who were overweight/obese also had relatively better OS (pinteraction = 0.06) when compared to White-patients. BMI was least associated with survival in Asian-patients and never-smokers. The outcomes of female ever-smokers at the extremes of BMI were associated with worse outcomes in both the underweight (pinteraction<0.001) and obese categories (pinteraction = 0.004) relative to the normal-BMI category, when compared to male ever-smokers. Conclusion: Underweight and obese female ever-smokers were associated with worse outcomes in White-patients. These BMI associations were not observed in Asian-patients and never-smokers. Black-patients had more favorable outcomes in the extremes of BMI when compared to White-patients.

Analysis of the 30-Pack-Year Smoking Threshold in African Americans From an Underserved Lung Cancer Screening Program,"Purpose: African Americans were underrepresented in lung cancer screening (LCS) trials, despite having higher lung cancer incidence and worse outcomes compared with Caucasians. There is concern that the 30-pack-year threshold excludes some African Americans who may benefit from LCS. Methods: LCS in an underserved health care system was reviewed. Providers attested that patients met LCS criteria, including 30-pack-year history, but patients also self-reported smoking histories. Self-reported data were used to identify patients with <30-pack-year histories. Results: Over 2 years, 784 patients self-reported sufficient data to calculate pack-years. The majority were men (57.5%), and 66.2% were African Americans. Median total years smoked was 40 (interquartile range, 30-45 years), and median pack-years was 25 (interquartile range, 15-40 pack-years). African Americans were more likely to report <30 pack-years compared with other races (P < .001). The overall incidence of lung cancer was 2.0%, and incidence was similar for those with ≥30 or <30 pack-years (2.1% versus 2.0%; odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-2.53; P =. 902). Race was not associated with lung cancer diagnosis, but African Americans were the only race to have lung cancer if pack-years were <30. The incidence of cancer in African Americans was similar in those who reported ≥30 or <30 pack-years (2.2% versus 2.7%; odds ratio, 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.39-3.75; P =. 740), and the 30-pack-year threshold was not associated with lung cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: This is the first review of LCS in African Americans who self-reported <30 pack-years. Although retrospective, these data raise concern that the 30-pack-year threshold may not be an appropriate LCS criterion in African Americans.","['Basu, A.', 'Kopulos, L.', 'Geissen, N.', 'Sukhal, S.', 'Smith, S.B.']",10.1016/j.jacr.2020.08.017
Personality and stigma in lung cancer patients,"Background: Stigma in lung cancer has been associated with diagnostic and treatment delay and with poor outcomes. Personality has impact on the perception of someone's life situation and interacts with psychosocial variables and coping strategies. The vulnerability to stigma is still under-researched. The aim of this study was to investigate this vulnerability by examining the associations between stigma and personality dimensions (i.e., temperament and character traits). Subjects and methods: Seventy six (76) inpatients of the two teaching hospitals with the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung cancer were consecutively included in the study. Patients were assessed with self-reporting scales: Cataldo Lung Cancer Stigma Scale (CLCSS) and Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected. Results: Personality dimensions Self-directedness and Persistence showed to be significant predictors of stigma in the linear regression (R=0.519; F=3.104; P=0.007). Stigma and personality dimensions were not associated with age, gender, tumor stage and smoking status. Conclusion: Stigma is associated with particular character (i.e., Self-directedness) and temperament (i.e., Persistence) dimensions. Given the negative clinical outcomes of stigma in lung cancer patients, personality should be taken into account during screening and treatment planning phases.","['Margetic, B.A.', 'Kukulj, S.', 'Galic, K.', 'Zolj, B.S.', 'Jakšiü, N.']",
Factors associated with early lung cancer mortality: a systematic review,"Introduction: Despite recent therapeutic advances, lung cancer remains the primary cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and early lung mortality was poorly studied. Area covered: Early lung-cancer mortality reflects local therapy (surgery or radiotherapy) impact (localized forms), and metastatic disease evolution, comorbidities and healthcare-system accessibility. The definition of early lung cancer mortality is not consensual; thresholds range from 1 to 12 months post-diagnosis. This systematic review was undertaken to identify and analyze factors significantly associated with early lung cancer mortality. Age, male sex, non-adenocarcinoma histology, advanced stage at diagnosis and ECOG performance status are the main clinical factors of early lung cancer mortality. Active/ex-smoking also seems to favor early mortality, despite heterogeneous definitions of smoker status. For radio-chemotherapy treated locally advance disease, the early mortality rate increases according to tumor volume. Less well studied, socioeconomic characteristics (rurality and social deprivation index) yielded contradictory results, partially because definitions vary over studies. However, early lung cancer mortality is significantly higher for lower socioeconomic class patients. Expert opinion: Prospective, observational, general population studies are needed to better evaluate early lung-cancer mortality. International consensus concerning the patient-, disease- or healthcare system-linked factors of interest to be collected would facilitate comparisons among countries.","['Goussault, H.', 'Gendarme, S.', 'Assié, J.B.', 'Bylicki, O.', 'Chouaïd, C.']",10.1080/14737140.2021.1941888
Effect of high quality nursing on alleviating negative emotions in patients with advanced lung cancer,"Objective: To analyze the risk factors of moderate and severe depression and to study the effect of high quality nursing on alleviating negative emotions and improving quality of life of patients with advanced lung cancer. Method: A total of 100 patients with advanced lung cancer were collected from our hospital. According to the SDS score before the nursing, the patients with SDS score ≤62 and >52 were enrolled in the mild depression group, and those with SDS score >62 were enrolled in the moderate, severe depression group. The risk factors that make mild depression develop into moderate/severe depression were studied. The patients were randomly divided into a control group (n = 50) and an observation group (n = 50). The patients in both groups were given routine nursing, and those in the observation group received high quality nursing on the basis of routine nursing. The QOL-C30 was used to evaluate the changes in quality of life. The SDS (Self-Rating Depression Scale) and SAS (Self-rating Anxiety Scale) were used for assessing the degree of anxiety and depression. The incidence of complications and the nursing satisfaction of patients were observed. Results: The multi-factor Logistic regression results showed that gender (OR: 3.398, 95% CI: 1.020-11.324), course of disease (OR: 0.676, 95% CI: 0.562~0.814), educational level (OR: 2.073, 95% CI: 1.165-3.688), and family income (OR: 1.676, 95% CI: 9.020) were the influence factors of moderate and severe depression. The QOL-30 score in the observation group was higher than those in the control group after nursing, and the changes in the observation group were significantly greater than those in the control group (P<0.05). After nursing, the observation group had much lower SAS and SDS scores and significantly greater changes than the control group (P<0.5). The total incidence of complications in the control group was statistically greatly higher than that in the observation group (P<0.05). The nursing satisfaction in the control group was statistically much lower than that in the observation group (P<0.5). Conclusions: Gender, course of disease, educational level, and family income are independent influencing factors of moderate and severe depression. High quality nursing can effectively improve the anxiety and depression, and quality of life of patients, which is worthy of being popularized clinically.","['Wu, Y.', 'Yao, J.', 'Zhao, J.', 'Wang, L.']",
Evaluation of Revised US Preventive Services Task Force Lung Cancer Screening Guideline among Women and Racial/Ethnic Minority Populations,"Importance: Lung cancer incidence and mortality disproportionately affect women and racial/ethnic minority populations, yet screening guidelines for the past several years were derived from clinical trials of predominantly White men. To reflect current evidence, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has revised the eligibility criteria, which may help to ameliorate sex- and race/ethnicity-related disparities in lung cancer screening. Objective: To determine the changes associated with the revised USPSTF guideline for lung cancer screening eligibility among female, Black, and Hispanic populations using a large nationwide survey. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included respondents to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System who were 50 to 80 years of age with a smoking history in 19 states that used the optional lung cancer screening module. The change in eligibility among female, male, Black, Hispanic, and White participants was examined. Eligibility by sex and race/ethnicity was compared with a reference population. Data were collected from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, and analyzed from May 8 to June 11, 2020. Exposures: Self-reported sex, race/ethnicity, age, and smoking history. Main Outcomes and Measures: Lung cancer screening eligibility using the revised USPSTF criteria. The previous criteria included current or past smokers (within 15 years) who were 55 to 80 years of age and had a smoking history of more than 30 pack-years. In the revised criteria, age was modified to 50 to 80 years; smoking history, to 20 pack-years. Results: Among 40869 respondents aged 50 to 80 years with a smoking history, 21265 (52.0%) were women, 3430 (8.4%) were Black, and 1226 (30.0%) were Hispanic (mean [SD] age, 65.6 [7.9] years). The revised criteria increased eligibility for the following populations: men (29.4% to 38.3% [8.9% difference]; P <.001), women (25.9% to 36.4% [10.5% difference]; P <.001), White individuals (31.1% to 40.9% [9.8% difference]; P <.001), Black individuals (16.3% to 28.8% [12.5% difference]; P <.001), and Hispanic individuals (10.5% to 18.7% [8.2% difference]; P <.001). The odds of eligibility were lower for women compared with men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.79-0.99; P =.04) and for Black (AOR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.33-0.56; P <.001) and Hispanic populations (AOR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.62-0.80; P <.001) compared with the White population. Conclusions and Relevance: The revised USPSTF guideline may likely increase lung cancer screening rates for female, Black, and Hispanic populations. However, despite these potential improvements, lung cancer screening inequities may persist without tailored eligibility criteria..","['Reese, T.J.', 'Schlechter, C.R.', 'Potter, L.N.', 'Kawamoto, K.', 'Del Fiol, G.', 'Lam, C.Y.', 'Wetter, D.W.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.33769
Differences in Uptake of Low-Dose CT Scan for Lung Cancer among White and Black Adult Smokers in the United States-2017,"To study racial/ethnic differences in the utilization of low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) scan for lung cancer among adult smokers. Cross-sectional data (n=2,640) of adults aged 55-74, were from the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Lung Cancer Screening module. Weighted, multivariable logistic regression was conducted. Most, 70.9%, were White and 52.2% male. About 16.0 % reported receiving LDCT scan in the past 12 months, 12.0% of Blacks and 17.4% of Whites. More Whites (55.0%) had ≥30 pack-years smoking history than Blacks (20%). Blacks had lower odds, .52 (CI: 0.28-0.96) of receiving LDCT scan than Whites. The odds of receiving LDCT scan were higher for those who were male, who tried to quit smoking in the past year, and for those with more education, health insurance, high blood pressure, lung disease, or cancer history (other than skin or lung cancer). This study suggests racial differences in the use of LDCT scan.","['Poghosyan, H.', 'Fortin, D.', 'Moen, E.L.', 'Quigley, K.S.', 'Young, G.J.']",10.1353/hpu.2021.0016
Evaluation of Population-Level Changes Associated with the 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force Lung Cancer Screening Recommendations in Community-Based Health Care Systems,"Importance: The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) released updated lung cancer screening recommendations in 2021, lowering the screening age from 55 to 50 years and smoking history from 30 to 20 pack-years. These changes are expected to expand screening access to women and racial and ethnic minority groups. Objective: To estimate the population-level changes associated with the 2021 USPSTF expansion of lung cancer screening eligibility by sex, race and ethnicity, sociodemographic factors, and comorbidities in 5 community-based health care systems. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study analyzed data of patients who received care from any of 5 community-based health care systems (which are members of the Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process Lung Consortium, a collaboration that conducts research to better understand how to improve the cancer screening processes in community health care settings) from January 1, 2010, through September 30, 2019. Individuals who had complete smoking history and were engaged with the health care system for 12 or more continuous months were included. Those who had never smoked or who had unknown smoking history were excluded. Exposures: Electronic health record-derived age, sex, race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), comorbidities, and smoking history. Main Outcomes and Measures: Differences in the proportion of the newly eligible population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, Charlson Comorbidity Index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease diagnosis, and SES as well as lung cancer diagnoses under the 2013 recommendations vs the expected cases under the 2021 recommendations were evaluated using χ2tests. Results: As of September 2019, there were 341163 individuals aged 50 to 80 years who currently or previously smoked. Among these, 34528 had electronic health record data that captured pack-year and quit-date information and were eligible for lung cancer screening according to the 2013 USPSTF recommendations. The 2021 USPSTF recommendations expanded screening eligibility to 18 533 individuals, representing a 53.7% increase. Compared with the 2013 cohort, the newly eligible 2021 population included 5833 individuals (31.5%) aged 50 to 54 years, a larger proportion of women (52.0% [n = 9631]), and more racial or ethnic minority groups. The relative increases in the proportion of newly eligible individuals were 60.6% for Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander; 67.4% for Hispanic; 69.7% for non-Hispanic Black; and 49.0% for non-Hispanic White groups. The relative increase for women was 13.8% higher than for men (61.2% vs 47.4%), and those with a lower comorbidity burden and lower SES had higher relative increases (eg, 68.7% for a Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 0; 61.1% for lowest SES). The 2021 recommendations were associated with an estimated 30% increase in incident lung cancer diagnoses compared with the 2013 recommendations. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study suggests that, in diverse health care systems, adopting the 2021 USPSTF recommendations will increase the number of women, racial and ethnic minority groups, and individuals with lower SES who are eligible for lung cancer screening, thus helping to minimize the barriers to screening access for individuals with high risk for lung cancer..","['Ritzwoller, D.P.', 'Meza, R.', 'Carroll, N.M.', 'Blum-Barnett, E.', 'Burnett-Hartman, A.N.', 'Greenlee, R.T.', 'Honda, S.A.', 'Neslund-Dudas, C.', 'Rendle, K.A.', 'Vachani, A.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.28176
Democratic and ethical problem of lung cancer screening: Exclusion of true high-risk populations. Can it be fixed? Yes,"Screening a population for a potentially deadly disease, the ultimate goal must be to prevent morbidity and mortality from this disease for the whole population. Unlike breast cancer or cervical cancer screening, where all women are screened after a certain age, CT screening for lung cancer has been based on selection of putative high-risk individuals based on age and smoking cut-off values. The type of selection used leaves too many high-risk individuals behind. The solution is to use only validated risk prediction models for selection.","['Røe, O.D.']",10.1136/bmjresp-2020-000811
Disparities in Follow-Up After Low-Dose Lung Cancer Screening,"The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated an improvement in overall survival with lung cancer screening. Achieving follow-up for a positive screen is essential to impact early intervention for lung cancer. The objective of this study was to determine predictors of follow-up after a positive lung cancer screening test. The NLST database was queried for participants with a positive lung cancer screening exam. This cohort was then subdivided into patients who had follow-up and those who did not. Pairwise comparison was performed within different subgroups. A logistic regression model was then utilized to identify predictive factors associated with follow-up. Of the 53,454 patients who participated in the study, we identified 14,000 patients who had a positive lung cancer screening test. Of those patients, 12,503 followed up appropriately (89.3%). Women had a statistically higher follow-up rate compared to men (90% vs 88.8%, P ≤ 0.05). Patients reported as married or living as married also showed a higher rate of follow-up compared to patients reported as never married, divorced, separated, or widowed (90.2% vs 87.5%, P ≤ 0.05). The rate of follow-up among African-American patients was 82.8%, while those in white patients was 89.6%, this was statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05). Education level was not a significant factor in follow-up rates. Current smokers followed up at lower rates compared to former smokers (87.9 % vs 90.6%, P ≤ 0.05). Logistic regression determined gender, marital status, race, and smoking status to be predictors of follow-up. Follow-up rates after a positive lung cancer screening test were associated with a patient's gender, marital status, race, and smoking status.","['Sesti, J.', 'Sikora, T.J.', 'Turner, D.S.', 'Turner, A.L.', 'Langan, R.C.', 'Nguyen, A.B.', 'Paul, S.']",10.1053/j.semtcvs.2019.10.006
"Understanding the associations between smoking-related risk perception, interest in quitting smoking, and interest in lung cancer screening among homeless adult smokers","Individuals experiencing homelessness smoke cigarettes at high rates, suffer a disproportionate incidence of lung cancer, but are unlikely to be screened to enhance early detection. Understanding correlates of lung cancer screening (LCS) interest within this vulnerable group may lend insight into prevention and treatment efforts and reduce their smoking-related morbidity and mortality. This study sought to understand how risk perception and interest in quitting smoking relate to LCS interest among homeless adults. Participants comprised a convenience sample of CO-verified current smokers (N = 310; 72.6% men, Mage = 43 + 11.7) from a homeless shelter in Dallas, TX. Participants self-reported risk perception, interest in quitting smoking, and interest in LCS. The average risk perception was 6.7 + 3.2 (range 0–10), 74.8% (n = 232) agreed or strongly agreed with interest in LCS, and 65.8% (n = 204) were interested in quitting smoking. Greater interest in quitting smoking, but not greater risk perception, was associated with greater interest in LCS (adjusted OR: 1.968, (95% CI: 1.213, 3.191), p = 0.006). Risk perception and interest in quitting smoking did not interact in their association with interest in LCS. Results suggest that homeless smokers with an interest in quitting may be receptive to LCS: a diagnostic tool by which cancers can be caught at earlier stages and prior to metastasis. However, few in the current sample would be eligible for LCS based on current guidelines; results have implications for altered screening practices among chronic smokers experiencing homelessness.","['Agrawal, P.', 'Taing, M.', 'Chen, T.-A.', 'Reuven, S.M.', 'Businelle, M.S.', 'Kendzor, D.E.', 'Bernicker, E.H.', 'Reitzel, L.R.']",10.3390/ijerph17238817
Health Disparities in Environmental and Occupational Lung Disease,"Pulmonary health disparities disproportionately impact disadvantaged and vulnerable populations. This article focuses on disparities in disease prevalence, morbidity, and mortality for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumoconiosis, and lung cancer. Disparities are categorized by race, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and geographic region. Each category highlights differences in risk factors for the development and severity of lung disease. Risk factors include social, behavioral, economic, and biologic determinants of health (occupational/environmental exposures, psychosocial stressors, smoking, health literacy, health care provider bias, and health care access). Many of these risk factors are complex and inter-related; strategies proposed to decrease disparities require multilevel approaches.","['Brigham, E.', 'Allbright, K.', 'Harris, D.']",10.1016/j.ccm.2020.08.009
Lung cancer screening eligibility and utilization among transgender patients: An analysis of the 2017–2018 United States behavioral risk factor surveillance system survey,"Introduction: Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons disproportionately face many health disparities including a higher risk of lung cancer. Lung cancer screening (LCS) using low-dose chest computed tomography has reduced lung cancer mortality in eligible high-risk smokers across several large trials, yet utilization of LCS remains low. TGD persons may be less likely to receive recommended cancer screening compared with cisgender populations. We sought to compare eligibility for and utilization of LCS between TGD and cisgender persons in the United States. We also examined if the utilization of LCS varied by smoking status within each gender identity group. Methods: We analyzed data from the 2017 and 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) cross-sectional survey to determine eligibility and utilization of LCS among TGD participants compared with cisgender persons. Logistical regression analysis of potentially confounding variables included age category, race/ethnicity, income, employment status, health insurance, and having a personal doctor. Results: Of 37 023 weighted respondents, 0.5% were TGD. Although eligibility for LCS was statistically similar (8.8% TGD vs. 12.2% cisgender) (adjusted odds ratio = 0.81, 95% confidence interval = 0.27–2.39, p = .703), only 2.3% of TGD participants reported obtaining a LCS chest computed tomography versus 17.2% of cisgender participants (adjusted odds ratio = 0.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.01–0.59, p = .019). Smoking status showed no association with LCS utilization among gender identity groups. Conclusions: TGD persons may be less likely to receive LCS despite having similar smoking status and eligibility of cisgender persons, suggesting a disparity in utilization of this preventative health service. Implications: Targeted efforts to increase LCS utilization and promote smoking cessation for at-risk TGD patients may be warranted.","['Stowell, J.T.', 'Parikh, Y.', 'Tilson, K.', 'Narayan, A.K.']",10.1093/ntr/ntaa127
Assessment of the psychosocial and economic impact according to sex in non-small cell lung cancer patients: an exploratory longitudinal study,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of sex on lung cancer patients from the psychological, economic and social perspectives. This study was designed to explore the psychosocial and economic impact according to sex of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) in patients and caregivers. METHODS: Exploratory study of two cohorts of patients starting first-line treatment for mNSCLC. The following questionnaires were administered at baseline, 4 months later and following the first and second disease progression: APGAR, relationship impact scale, DUKE-UNC scale, economic impact in patients and caregiver, and Zarit scale. It was planned to include 1250 patients to get an 80% possibility of detecting as significant (p < 0.05) effect sizes less than 0.19 between men and women. Univariate comparisons were made between the tests applied to men and women. Overall survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier method. Cox analyses were done to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI. RESULTS: 333 patients were included. Most families reported to continue being functional despite the lung cancer diagnosis. Regardless of sex, they did not perceive changes in their partner relationship. Most patients felt their social support was normal. Roughly 25% of people reported a worsening in their economic situation, without remarkable differences by sex. Statistically significant differences were found between both groups regarding the caregiver's relationship to the patient (more parents were the caregiver in females than in males, p < 0.0001) and the caregiver's employment situation (more employed caregivers in females) (p < 0.0001). Most caregivers of both sexes considered that taking care of their relative did not pose a significant burden. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a preliminary insight into sex-related characteristics in the management of advanced NSCLC and its impact on the emotional, social and economic burden of patients and their caregivers, and recall the high priority of researching in cancer from a sex perspective. Nevertheless, due to the low recruitment rate and the relevant loss of patients during the follow-up, it was difficult to find differences by sex.

Variation in cancer survival between hospital districts and within them in Finland,"Background: Monitoring regional variation in population-based cancer survival is useful for assessing equity in national health-care system. This study quantifies variation in survival between municipalities and hospital districts responsible for primary care and for specialised care, respectively, in Finland. Material and methods: Five-year relative survival of 11 cancers and close to 700,000 patients was estimated by municipality in Finland over 1962–2016 using hierarchical Bayesian modelling. Variation (i) between hospital districts, (ii) between municipalities within hospital districts, and (iii) between all municipalities (total variation) were quantified by the standard deviation of 5-year relative survival standardised by the average survival level. Results: In 2007–2016, the largest variation in 5-year relative survival between all municipalities was in stomach, prostate, kidney and liver cancer and skin melanoma. In male skin melanoma, prostate, and kidney cancer and in male and female pancreatic cancer, there was substantial and statistically significant variation between hospital districts, too. Variation within hospital districts was on average 67% (95% posterior interval [58%,76%]) out of the total variation and had decreased by 18% [2%, 33%] from 1997–2006. Conclusion: The decrease in variation within hospital districts suggests that equity in diagnostics and primary care has improved in Finland. However, the variation between hospital districts in skin melanoma, prostate and kidney cancer reflects differences in early diagnostics. In pancreatic cancer, substantial variation between hospital districts may relate to regional differences in the accessibility and the quality of cancer treatments.","['Seppä, K.', 'Malila, N.', 'Pitkäniemi, J.']",10.1080/0284186X.2020.1772500
"Efficacy and Safety of Anti-PD-1 Immunotherapy in Patients Aged ≥ 75 Years With Non–small-cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC): An Italian, Multicenter, Retrospective Study","Introduction: Non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is predominantly a disease of the elderly population. Over the past few years, immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies named checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) greatly improved the clinical management of a significant proportion of patients with metastatic NSCLC. However, pivotal trials excluded older patients, although, given the favorable clinical profile of ICIs, this treatment may be revealed to be a most valuable option also for these patients. To this aim, a multicenter retrospective analysis was performed on patients aged ≥ 75 years with NSCLC treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy. Material and Methods: Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (stage IIIB or IV, according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification system, version 8.0); age ≥ 75 years; treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in first or subsequent lines of treatment; absence of epidermal growth factor receptor-activating mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase and ROS-1 rearrangements. The primary endpoints of the study were the efficacy, in terms of overall response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival, and safety, by means of evaluations of the incidence of immune-related adverse events. Results: Eighty-six patients were considered for the final analysis; 71 (82.6%) were male. The mean age was 78.5 years (range, 75-86 years; SD, 3.12 years). Of the 86 patients, 69 (80.2%) of patients had a performance status of 0 or 1. The overall median progression-free survival was 5.6 months (range 1-36 months; SD, 7.5 months,) whereas the median overall survival was 10.1 months (range, 1.7-34.8 months; SD, 8 months). At the Cox regression analysis, the only parameter significantly associated with survival was the smoking status (P =.008). No difference in survival was found between patients younger and older than 80 years. Conclusions: In the present real-world retrospective cohort, efficacy and toxicity profiles of ICIs in older patients with advanced NSCLC were comparable with those observed in younger patients enrolled in clinical trials.","['Luciani, A.', 'Marra, A.', 'Toschi, L.', 'Cortinovis, D.', 'Fava, S.', 'Filipazzi, V.', 'Tuzi, A.', 'Cerea, G.', 'Rossi, S.', 'Perfetti, V.', 'Rossi, A.', 'Giannetta, L.', 'Sala, L.', 'Finocchiaro, G.', 'Pizzutilo, E.G.', 'Carelli, S.', 'Agustoni, F.', 'Cergnul, M.', 'Zonato, S.', 'Siena, S.', 'Bidoli, P.', 'Ferrari, D.']",10.1016/j.cllc.2020.05.004
"Compression, expansion, or maybe both? Growing inequalities in lung cancer in Germany","Background Lung Cancer (LC) is one of the most common malign diseases worldwide. So far, it is unclear if the development of LC incidence and mortality leads to morbidity compression or expansion and whether these developments differ by socioeconomic characteristics. This study analyses time trends in social and gender inequalities in life years with and without LC in Germany. Methods The study is based on data of a large German statutory health insurance provider (N = 2,511,790). Incidence and mortality risks were estimated from multistate survival models. Trends in life years with and without LC were analysed using multistate life table analyses. All analyses were performed separately for gender, time period (2006–2009 and 2014–2017), and income group (<60% and ≥60% of the German average income). Results Among men, declining LC incidence rates resulted in gains of life years free of LC and declining LC- affected life years and led to a relative compression, which was strongest in men with higher incomes. Among women, a clear increase in life years with LC led to an expansion of the lifespan affected by LC. This expansion was mainly driven by increasing incidence rates in women with low incomes. Overall, income inequalities in LC increased in both genders. Conclusions Our analyses reveal that developments in the length of life affected by LC differed substantially by gender and income and led to widening health inequalities over time. Public health efforts should mainly focus on vulnerable groups to reduce the persisting social inequalities in LC.","['Tetzlaff, F.', 'Epping, J.', 'Golpon, H.', 'Tetzlaff, J.']",10.1371/journal.pone.0242433
Regional differences in tobacco smoking and lung cancer in Portugal in 2018: A population-based analysis using nationwide incidence and mortality data,"Objectives This study aims to estimate the proportion of lung cancer cases and deaths attributable to tobacco smoking in Portugal in 2018, complemented by trends in incidence and mortality, by sex and region. Design Cancer cases for 1998-2011 and cancer deaths for 1991-2018 were obtained from population-based registries and Statistics Portugal, respectively. We projected cases for 2018 and used reported deaths for the same year to estimate, using Peto's method, the number and proportion of lung cancer cases and deaths caused by tobacco smoking in 2018. We calculated the age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates in each year of diagnosis and death. We fitted a joinpoint regression to the observed data to estimate the annual percentage change (APC) in the rates. Setting Portugal. Results In 2018, an estimated 3859 cases and 3192 deaths from lung cancer were attributable to tobacco smoking in Portugal, with men presenting a population attributable fraction (PAF) of 82.6% (n=3064) for incidence and 84.1% (n=2749) for mortality, while in women those values were 51.0% (n=795) and 42.7% (n=443), respectively. In both sexes and metrics, the Azores were the region with the highest PAF and the Centre with the lowest. During 1998-2011, the APC for incidence ranged from 0.6% to 3.0% in men and 3.6% to 7.9% in women, depending on region, with mortality presenting a similar pattern between sexes. Conclusion Exposure to tobacco smoking has accounted for most of the lung cancer cases and deaths estimated in Portugal in 2018. Differential patterns of tobacco consumption across the country, varying implementation of primary prevention programmes and differences in personal cancer awareness may have contributed to the disparities observed. Primary prevention of lung cancer remains a public health priority, particularly among women.","['Forjaz, G.', 'Bastos, J.', 'Castro, C.', 'Mayer, A.', 'Noone, A.-M.', 'Chen, H.-S.', 'Mariotto, A.B.']",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-038937
Patient motivations for non-adherence to lung cancer screening in a military population,"Background: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, and lung cancer screening has been shown to decrease this mortality. Adherence to lung cancer screening is paramount to realize the mortality benefit, and reported adherence rates vary widely. Few reports address non-adherence to screening, and our study sought to understand the non-compliant patients in our military population. Methods: This Institutional Review Board approved retrospective review of patients enrolled in our screening program from 2013-2019 identified patients who failed to obtain a subsequent Low Dose CT scan (LDCT) within 15 months of their prior scan. Attempts were made to contact these patients and elucidate motivations for non-adherence via telephone. Results: Of the 242 patients enrolled, 183 (76%) patients were adherent to the protocol. Significant predictors of non-adherence versus adherence were younger age (P=0.008), female sex (P=0.005), and enlisted officer rank (P=0.03). There was no difference with regards to race, smoking status, pack-years, negative screens, lung-RADS level, or nodule size. 31 (52%) non-adherent patients were contacted, and 24 (77%) reported their reason for non-adherence was lack of follow-up for a LDCT. Twenty (64%) were interested in re-enrollment. Of the total screening cohort, 15 interventions were performed, with lung cancer identified in 5 (2%)-a 67% false positive rate. One stage IV lung cancer was found in a non-adherent patient who re-enrolled. Conclusions: Lack of perceived contact for follow-up was expressed as the primary reason for noncompliance in our screening program. Compliance is critical to the efficacy of any screening modality, and adherence rates to lung cancer screening may be increased through improved contact with patients via multiple avenues (i.e., phone, email, and letter). There is benefit in contacting non-adherent patients as high rates of re-enrollment are possible.","['Seastedt, K.P.', 'Luca, M.J.', 'Antevil, J.L.', 'Browning, R.F.', 'Mullenix, P.S.', 'Reoma, J.L.', 'McKay, S.A.']",10.21037/jtd-20-1841
Treatments for combined small cell lung cancer patients,"Background: Combined small cell lung cancer (CSCLC) is a subtype of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) which contains both components of SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prognostic outcomes and treatment strategy of it are still unclear. A large-scale retrospective study was performed to investigate proper treatments for CSCLC. Methods: All cases of CSCLC were identified from the SEER database during the period of 2004-2016. Clinical characteristics, first-line treatments, surgical procedures and survival data including overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed. Results: A total of 37,639 SCLC patients were identified. CSCLC accounted for 2.1% (784/37,639). The mean age of CSCLC cohort is 67.3±9.9 years old. Male and white ethnicity patients were accounted for larger proportions (55.7% and 80.4%). The oncological characteristics of CSCLC were consistent with SCLC that most of patients were diagnosed as higher grade and advanced stages. The prognosis of CSCLC was better than SCLC but worse than NSCLC in IA-IIIA stages. No difference was observed in IIIB-IV. Surgery was beneficial in IA-IB stage CSCLC. Adjuvant chemotherapy seemed to have few effects on early stage patients. Trimodality treatment could significantly improve OS in IIA-IIIA CSCLC patients. Chemotherapy-based treatment is predominant choice in advanced stage patients. Conclusions: CSCLC is a rare and special subtype of SCLC. It has better survival outcome than non-CSCLC in early stage. Surgical treatment is crucial in early stage of CSCLC. Prognostic improvement might be achieved from trimodality treatment in stage IIA-IIIA. Chemotherapy-based treatments should be considered in advanced stage. The effect of surgical treatments in advanced stage patients should be further investigated.","['He, J.', 'Xu, S.', 'Pan, H.', 'Li, S.', 'He, J.']",10.21037/tlcr-20-437
"Cancer Stage at Diagnosis, Historical Redlining, and Current Neighborhood Characteristics: Breast, Cervical, Lung, and Colorectal Cancers, Massachusetts, 2001-2015","In the 1930s, maps created by the federal Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC) nationalized residential racial segregation via ""redlining,""whereby HOLC designated and colored in red areas they deemed to be unsuitable for mortgage lending on account of their Black, foreign-born, or low-income residents. We used the recently digitized HOLC redlining maps for 28 municipalities in Massachusetts to analyze Massachusetts Cancer Registry data for late stage at diagnosis for cervical, breast, lung, and colorectal cancer (2001-2015). Multivariable analyses indicated that, net of age, sex/gender, and race/ethnicity, residing in a previously HOLC-redlined area imposed an elevated risk for late stage at diagnosis, even for residents of census tracts with present-day economic and racial privilege, whereas the best historical HOLC grade was not protective for residents of census tracts without such current privilege. For example, a substantially elevated risk of late stage at diagnosis occurred among men with lung cancer residing in currently privileged areas that had been redlined (risk ratio = 1.17, 95% confidence interval: 1.06, 1.29), whereas such risk was attenuated among men residing in census tracts lacking such current privilege (risk ratio = 1.01, 95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.08). Research on historical redlining as a structural driver of health inequities is warranted.","['Krieger, N.', 'Wright, E.', 'Chen, J.T.', 'Waterman, P.D.', 'Huntley, E.R.', 'Arcaya, M.']",10.1093/aje/kwaa045
"Global, regional, and national burden of lung cancer and its attributable risk factors, 1990 to 2017","Background: China's lung cancer (LC) burden plays a pivotal role in the global cancer epidemic. Comparing LC burden and population attributable fractions (PAFs) of risk factors between China and other countries/regions is essential to inform effective intervention. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides a unique opportunity for such comparisons. Methods: We extracted the number of LC deaths, age-standardized death rates (ASDRs), age-standardized disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) rates, and PAFs of risk factors for LC deaths between 1990 and 2017 from GBD 2017. The annual percentage change (APC) was used to quantify the trends of LC ASDRs and age-standardized DALY rates. The relationship between the APC of LC ASDR and Socio-demographic Index was assessed among China and other countries. Results: Globally, the ASDR for LC decreased in men (APC, −0.66% [95% CI, −0.69 to −0.62]) but increased in women (APC, 0.31% [95% CI, 0.26 to 0.36]) from 1990 to 2017. The ASDRs in China increased both for men (APC, 1.12% [95% CI, 1.03 to 1.20]) and women (APC, 0.80% [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.89]). The increased LC death numbers among men (312,798) and women (139,115) in China accounted for 59.39% and 43.01% of global increases. LC years of life lost accounted for the majority of LC DALYs globally and in China. The risk factors with the highest PAFs of LC death in China were smoking and ambient particulate matter. The ASDRs for LC associated with ambient particulate matter in China ranked second globally. Conclusions: The trends of LC ASDRs and age-standardized DALY rates and the PAFs of risk factors vary markedly by region, indicating a need for tailored measures to reduce LC burden and improve health equality. China's LC ASDRs are among the highest in the world, and the primary intervention priorities in China should be control of ambient particulate matter and tobacco usage.","['Wang, N.', 'Mengersen, K.', 'Tong, S.', 'Kimlin, M.', 'Zhou, M.', 'Hu, W.']",10.1002/cncr.33078
Are there social gradients in the occurrence of lung cancer and in the survival of lung cancer patients? Findings from an observational study using German claims data of Lower Saxony,"OBJECTIVES: Only a few studies on health inequalities in terms of lung cancer are available. We examined whether social inequalities are present for the occurrence of lung cancer. Confining the analyses to patients, it was also examined whether survival over the observation period and over a standardised period of 18 months differed by occupational position and income. METHODS: Our findings are based on claims data from a German statutory health insurance covering 2005-2016. The database comprised N=3 163 211 women (50.7%) and men (49.3%) aged 18 years and older. Diagnoses (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision: C34.0 to C34.9) were hospital-based, and income and occupational position were used as indicators of socioeconomic position. Analyses on social gradients were performed for employed and retired insured, but only for employed insured information on occupation and on income were available, for retired women and men only income was available. Analyses were performed by means of proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: In employed women, social gradients for the occurrence emerged for occupational position, but not for income. In men, social differences were found for both indicators. For retired insured, income gradients were found in men. Looking at overall survival, neither in women nor in men social gradients emerged. CONCLUSIONS: The reported social inequalities in the occurrence of lung cancer are pointing towards social differences in smoking behaviour, exposition to hazardous occupation-related substances and differences in preventive strategies. The absence of social inequalities in survival after lung cancer suggests equality in medical treatment of the disease.","['Schröder, S.', 'Beller, J.', 'Golpon, H.', 'Geyer, S.']",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-036506
Dysphagia prevalence and associated survival differences in older patients with lung cancer: A SEER-Medicare population-based study,"Introduction: The impact of dysphagia in persons with lung cancer is unknown. The objective of this study is to measure the prevalence and survival differences associated with dysphagia in older adults with lung cancer. Materials and Methods: Linked SEER cancer registries - Medicare data, 1991–2009 was utilized to identify 201,674 persons with lung cancer. Most were male (53%), had regional or distant disease (74%), and were aged <80 years (82%). The pre-existing prevalence of dysphagia was identified using claims codes before the lung cancer diagnosis. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: 8517 (4%) had dysphagia prior to their lung cancer diagnoses. Younger age, worse disease stage, more comorbidities, and hospital rurality were associated with higher likelihood of dysphagia. Patients with dysphagia had worse survival (median survival 8 months [95%CI 7,9]) than those without dysphagia (median survival 12 months [95%CI 11,13]). After adjusting for sociodemographic, clinical, and disease characteristics, dysphagia was still associated with worse survival (Hazard ratio of death 1.34, [95%CI 1.28–1.35], p ≤ .0001). Discussion and Conclusions: This is the first Medicare claims-based study of older adults with lung cancer and dysphagia. Pre-existing dysphagia occurred in approximately 1 in 25 patients with lung cancer and was associated with worse survival. Determining the best methods to evaluate and treat dysphagia in patients with lung cancer is an important avenue for future studies.","['Marmor, S.', 'Cohen, S.', 'Fujioka, N.', 'Cho, L.C.', 'Bhargava, A.', 'Misono, S.']",10.1016/j.jgo.2020.02.015
Lung Cancer Screening: Characteristics of Nonparticipants and Potential Screening Barriers,"Background: Patients eligible and referred for lung cancer screening (LCS) may not complete the visit. We aimed to identify differences in demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic characteristics between LCS participants and LCS-eligible nonparticipants and determine potential reasons for nonparticipation. Materials and Methods: LCS-eligible patients referred between April 2015 and August 2016 were divided into participants and nonparticipants. Retrospective data were collected. A telephone survey was conducted in a subset of nonparticipants to identify reasons for not participating and assess their understanding of the benefits and harms of LCS. Results: We identified 542 participants and 276 LCS-eligible nonparticipants. Female sex, lower pack-years, active smoking, the absence of a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, or liver disease, and chronic kidney disease or a history of malignancy were associated with not participating. One hundred nonparticipants completed the telephone survey—29% were unaware of the appointment; 19% had concerns about the distance from the screening site and 14% with insurance coverage; 10% had fear of the imaging result; and 10% felt the computed tomography scan was unnecessary. Eighteen percent knew the benefit of LCS, and 69% were not aware of any screening harms. Conclusions: LCS-eligible nonparticipants are more likely to be female, active smokers, have fewer total pack-years of smoking, chronic kidney disease, a history of prior malignancy, and not have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, or liver disease. Targeted education about the benefits and harms of LCS, verification of insurance coverage, and providing convenient screening locations may improve participation.","['Raju, S.', 'Khawaja, A.', 'Han, X.', 'Wang, X.', 'Mazzone, P.J.']",10.1016/j.cllc.2019.11.016
Impact of invasive nodal staging on regional and distant recurrence rates after SBRT for inoperable stage I NSCLC,"Purpose/Objectives: Before definitive stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for presumably node-negative, early-stage NSCLC, many patients are staged with PET/CT alone. In patients undergoing PET/CT prior to SBRT, the role of invasive nodal staging (INS) with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or mediastinoscopy is uncertain. We sought to characterize the impact of nodal staging modality on outcomes. Materials/Methods: Patients receiving definitive SBRT for T1-2N0 NSCLC deemed node-negative by either PET/CT plus INS (EBUS or mediastinoscopy) or PET/CT alone were identified. Patients with initially equivocal or positive nodes on PET/CT were excluded from this analysis. All patients received 3–5 fraction SBRT according to institutional guidelines. Control was assessed by at least one follow-up CT in all patients. Multivariable logistic regression (MVA) was performed to identify variables independently associated with use of INS. Results: We identified 651 eligible patients at our institution from 2005–2016. INS was performed in 15.2% of patients (n = 99) with EBUS (n = 78) or mediastinoscopy (n = 21). Median follow-up was 19.4 months (0.2–135.1). Median survival was 28.5 months (0.6–140). Factors predictive of increased likelihood of INS after negative PET/CT on MVA were age (OR for decreasing age 1.033; 95% CI 1.058–1.010), Caucasian race (OR vs. non-white 1.852; 1.044–3.289), male sex (1.629; 1.031–2.575), central location (1.978; 1.218–3.211) and squamous histology (2.564; 1.243–5.287). Nodal and/or distant control at 2 years was similar between PET/CT alone (78%, 95% CI 74–82%) and INS + PET/CT (75%, 95% CI 65–85%) (p = 0.877) as well as on MVA. Overall survival did not differ based on staging modality. Conclusions: In patients with early-stage NSCLC deemed node-negative by PET/CT, addition of INS did not appreciably alter patterns of failure or survival after definitive SBRT. This study does not question the established value of INS for equivocal or suspicious nodes.","['Kennedy, W.R.', 'Samson, P.P.', 'Gabani, P.', 'Nikitas, J.', 'Bradley, J.D.', 'Roach, M.C.', 'Robinson, C.G.']",10.1016/j.radonc.2020.06.043
"Lung cancer: A nationwide study to characterize sex differences, incidence, and spatial patterns in portugal","Background/Aim: This study characterized lung cancer (LC) in Portugal, to capture sex differences, regional variation, and spatial distribution. Patients and Methods: Variables: Age, sex, vital status, region of residence, degree of urbanization, histologic types and stage at diagnosis. Spatial analyses conducted to identify high (HIC) and low incidence (LIC) clusters. Results: In total, 11,642 cases were diagnosed (76.6% male, 23.4% female), with a similar mean age at diagnosis. There were 23,6% locally advanced and 58.4% metastatic disease cases, with 13.4% alive five years after diagnosis. Nonsmall- cell LC accounted for 77.3% of which 40.8% was adenocarcinoma and 22.7% was squamous cell carcinoma. Standardized incident rate (IR) was 37.5/105, 65.2/105 in males, and 15.7/105 in females, with four HIC (urban) clusters and four LIC (non-urban). Conclusion: This study highlighted the sex differences in incidence, mortality, histology, and geographic distribution of LC in Portugal. Considering the advanced stages and the poor overall survival, understanding sex and geographic differences is important for public health interventions.","['Guerreiro, T.', 'Antunes, L.', 'Bastos, J.', 'Mayer, A.', 'Forjaz, G.', 'Araujo, A.', 'Nunes, C.']",10.21873/invivo.12092
Lung Cancer Staging at Diagnosis in the Veterans Health Administration: Is Rurality an Influencing Factor? A Cross-Sectional Study,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the association between rurality and lung cancer stage at diagnosis. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data to identify veterans newly diagnosed with lung cancer between October 1, 2011 and September 30, 2015. We defined rurality, based on place of residence, using Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes with the subcategories of urban, large rural, small rural, and isolated. We used multivariable logistic regression models to determine associations between rurality and stage at diagnosis, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. We also analyzed data using the RUCA code for patients' assigned primary care sites and driving distances to primary care clinics and medical centers. FINDINGS: We identified 4,220 veterans with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 25,978 with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Large rural residence (compared to urban) was associated with early-stage diagnosis of NSCLC (OR = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.00-1.24) and SCLC (OR = 1.73; 95% CI: 1.18-1.55). However, the finding was significant only in the southern and western regions of the country. White race, female sex, chronic lung disease, higher comorbidity, receiving primary care, being a former tobacco user, and more recent year of diagnosis were also associated with diagnosing early-stage NSCLC. Driving distance to medical centers was inversely associated with late-stage NSCLC diagnoses, particularly for large rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find clear associations between rurality and lung cancer stage at diagnosis. These findings highlight the complex relationship between rurality and lung cancer within VHA, suggesting access to care cannot be fully captured by current rurality codes.","['Sanchez, R.', 'Zhou, Y.', 'Sarrazin, M.S.V.', 'Kaboli, P.J.', 'Charlton, M.', 'Hoffman, R.M.']",10.1111/jrh.12429

Survival value of primary tumour resection for stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer: A population-based study of 6466 patients,"Introduction: For stage IV non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, surgical resection of primary tumour was rarely recommended. Objectives: We conducted this population-based study to demonstrate the survival value of primary tumour resection (PTR) for stage IV (NSCLC). Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database was searched for selecting stage IV NSCLC patients. The patients were matched according to age, gender, grade, primary tumour site, histopathological type, tumour size and regional lymph nodes metastasis by propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves were presented to show the survival differences between resection group and non-resection group. Risk factors which were supposed to influence survival outcome were investigated using a Cox proportional hazard regression model. And a nomogram was performed to present prognostic factors for stage IV NSCLC patients. Results: 6466 patients diagnosed from 2004 to 2015 were included in survival analyses after PSM. The median overall survival (OS) for overall patients with resection was 27 months, much longer than those without resection (8 months). And this trend remained in subgroup analyses, including different histopathological types and distant metastases (All P values < 0.001). Younger age, race other than white and black, female, grade 1/2 (G1/G2), PTR, chemotherapy, no other distant metastases, smaller tumour size and no regional lymph node metastases were favourable prognostic factors for stage IV NSCLC. A predictive nomogram was conducted based on above risk factors. Conclusion: PTR prolonged survival of stage IV NSCLC patients. And PTR should be considered in clinical practice for stage IV NSCLC.","['Xu, J.', 'Fan, L.', 'Yu, H.', 'Lu, D.', 'Peng, W.', 'Sun, G.']",10.1111/crj.13194
Macroeconomic environment and insurance-mortality relationship: An analysis of gender-based disparity among non-elderly adult patients of melanoma and lung cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Cancer patients exhibit disparity in mortality risks across demographic divisions as well as insurance groups. The effects of macroeconomic environment also vary for such strata. This study analyses the gaps between mortality risks for male and female cancer patients with and without insurance and examines how such gaps transform over time with macroeconomic shifts. METHODS: Demographic, clinical and treatment records of 45,750 melanoma and 91,157 lung cancer patients diagnosed in 2007-2009 and 2011-2013 were extracted from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Kaplan-Meier test was applied to ascertain survival probability of each insurance group, while Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess relative mortality risk for Medicaid and uninsured patients, for the whole data as well as separately for both time periods and genders. RESULTS: Both the hazard ratios and change thereof over time are greater for female patients without insurance, than for male patients. More than any insurance-gender subgroup, uninsured female patients of melanoma have much increased hazard ratios, from 1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.92] to 2.22 [95% CI, 1.67-2.94]. CONCLUSION: Despite diagnostic improvements and technology advancements, the adverse effects of macroeconomic crisis are associated with increased relative mortality risks for cancer patients without insurance, more for women than men.","['Adnan, H.', 'Adnan, S.M.', 'Deng, K.', 'Yang, C.', 'Hou, Y.', 'Ngo Nkondjock, V.R.', 'Li, K.']",10.1111/ecc.13229
Lung Cancer Stigma: Does Smoking History Matter?,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer patients commonly report stigma, often attributing it to the well-established association of smoking as the leading preventable cause. Theory and research suggest that patients' smoking history may differentiate patients' experience of lung cancer stigma. However, there is inconsistent evidence whether lung cancer stigma varies by patients' smoking history, owing to limitations in the literature. PURPOSE: This study examined differences in lung cancer patients' reported experience of lung cancer stigma by smoking history. METHOD: Participants (N = 266, 63.9% female) were men and women with lung cancer who completed a validated, multidimensional questionnaire measuring lung cancer stigma. Multivariable regression models characterized relationships between smoking history (currently, formerly, and never smoked) and lung cancer stigma, controlling for psychological and sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS: Participants who currently smoked reported significantly higher total, internalized, and perceived lung cancer stigma compared to those who formerly or never smoked (all p < .05). Participants who formerly smoked reported significantly higher total and internalized stigma compared to those who never smoked (p < .001). Participants reported similar levels of constrained disclosure, regardless of smoking history (p = .630). CONCLUSIONS: Total, internalized, and perceived stigma vary meaningfully by lung cancer patients' smoking history. Patients who smoke at diagnosis are at risk for experiencing high levels of stigma and could benefit from psychosocial support. Regardless of smoking history, patients reported similar levels of discomfort in sharing information about their lung cancer diagnosis with others. Future studies should test relationships between health-related stigma and associated health behaviors in other stigmatized groups.","['Williamson, T.J.', 'Kwon, D.M.', 'Riley, K.E.', 'Shen, M.J.', 'Hamann, H.A.', 'Ostroff, J.S.']",10.1093/abm/kaz063
Micropapillary Predominant Lung Adenocarcinoma in Stage IA Benefits from Adjuvant Chemotherapy,"Purpose: The benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy remains unknown for patients with stage IA micropapillary predominant (MPP) lung adenocarcinoma (ADC). This study investigated the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in ADC and MPP patients in stage IA. Methods: A total of 5220 stage IA lung ADC patients from SEER database and 152 MPP subtype patients from Qilu Hospital of Shandong University were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score matching analysis was used to adjust the confounding factors. The benefits of improved overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected stage IA ADC or MPP patients were investigated. Results: Based on SEER database, for ADC patients in stage IA, chemotherapy (no vs. yes: hazard ratio [HR]: 0.674, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.474–0.958, P = 0.030), together with radiotherapy (no vs. yes: HR: 0.519, 95% CI 0.358–0.751, P = 0.001), race, gender, age, and T stage were all statistically significant independent factors for OS. However, in propensity model, there was no significant difference in OS between patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy and those who did not. Only age was a significant prognostic predictor for OS. For patients with MPP subtype in stage IA, multivariate analysis revealed that chemotherapy (no vs. yes: HR: 2.054, 95% CI 1.085–3.886, P = 0.027) as well as T stage were prognostic predictors for OS. Chemotherapy (no vs. yes: HR: 2.205, 95% CI 1.118–4.349, P = 0.022) and T stage also were significant predictors for PFS. Conclusions: Adjuvant chemotherapy is a favorable prognostic factor for MPP patients in stage IA but not for lung ADC patients.

National and subnational trends in incidence and mortality of lung cancer in Iran from 1990 to 2016,"Aim: Lung cancer is the most common cancer in incidence and mortality worldwide. The aim of the current study was to present population-based estimates of lung cancer epidemiology by gender and age group at national and subnational levels during the 27-year period of 1990-2016. Methods: This study was part of the NASBOD project (National and Subnational Burden of Disease, Injuries, and Risk Factors). Cancer incidence and mortality statistics were obtained from the Iran Cancer Registry database and the national Death Registration System. The two-stage mixed effects and spatiotemporal model were fitted to all-cancer incidence and mortality data. Thereafter, the cancer-specific incidence and mortality fraction for each age group, gender, province, and year were applied to the data to estimate the lung cancer incidence and mortality. Results: The age-standardized incidence rate showed a sevenfold increase during 27 years of the study. Lung cancer deaths showed an upward trend from 1990 to 2001 and subsequently decreased during the latter half of the study period. At provincial level, there was a wide range between the lowest and highest, from 3.2 to 13.2 in incidence rate and from 5.2 to 10.7 in mortality rate. Conclusion: The study showed an increasing trend in lung cancer incidence at national and subnational levels from 1990 to 2016, while the mortality rate peaked and then declined in the 2000s. The increasing trend of lung cancer in the overall population and the provincial disparities necessitate urgent implementation of preventive strategies and cancer control policies.","['Rajai, N.', 'Ghanbari, A.', 'Yoosefi, M.', 'Mohebi, F.', 'Mohajer, B.', 'Sheidaei, A.', 'Gohari, K.', 'Masinaei, M.', 'Haghshenas, R.', 'Kompani, F.', 'Vaezi, M.', 'Farzadfar, F.']",10.1111/ajco.13303
Efficacy and safety of ALK inhibitors in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Objectives: No overall survival (OS) benefit has been reported from a mature randomized trial with the use of ALK inhibitors. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of ALK inhibitors compared to chemotherapy (ALK vs. chemo) and 2nd generation ALK inhibitors compared to 1 st generation ALK inhibitors (ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G). Methods: The electronic databases Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched for relevant randomized trials. Pooled hazard ratios (HR) for OS and progression free survival (PFS), and pooled risk ratios for objective response rates (ORR) and toxicity were meta-analyzed using the generic inverse variance and the Mantel-Haenszel methods. To account for between-studies heterogeneity, random-effect models were used. Subgroup analyses compared PFS by gender, smoking status, brain metastases, race and age. Results: Six trials were included in the analysis of ALK vs. chemo and four in the analysis of ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G. Treatment with ALK inhibitors improved OS compared to chemotherapy (HR: 0.84, 95 %CI 0.72−0.97) while a trend toward a better OS was seen with ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G (HR: 0.66, 95 %CI 0.43–1.02). PFS was improved with ALK vs. chemo and ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G (HR: 0.44, 95 %CI 0.35−0.54 and HR: 0.38, 95 %CI-0.29−0.51, respectively). ORR was improved with ALK vs. chemo and ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G. No difference in toxicity was observed. Conclusions: This meta-analysis is the first, to our knowledge, to report an OS and PFS benefit with the use of ALK inhibitors compared to chemotherapy from randomized trial data. A trend toward a better OS was also seen with ALK-2 G vs. ALK-1 G and this is likely because of crossover effects and limited OS follow-up. Longer follow up and further research are warranted to directly compare ALK inhibitor sequences and to understand the outcomes of second generation ALK inhibitors as initial therapy.","['Breadner, D.', 'Blanchette, P.', 'Shanmuganathan, S.', 'Boldt, R.G.', 'Raphael, J.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2020.04.011
The prevalence and prognostic significance of estrogen receptor beta expression in non-small cell lung cancer,"Background: Estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) is the predominant estrogen receptor (ER) expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, due to methodological disparities among prior studies, the prognostic value of ERβ expression in NSCLC remains unclear. Our objective was to apply improved detection and analysis techniques to assess the prognostic value of ERβ expression in NSCLC. Methods: A tissue microarray (TMA) was used which contained resected and biopsy specimens from 299 patients diagnosed at a single center with stages I–IV NSCLC. Sections of this array were stained using high-sensitivity fluorescence immunohistochemistry, with the well-validated PPG5/10 monoclonal antibody. Digital images of the stained array slides were analyzed using software-based image analysis, which reported ERβ expression as a continuous variable in different subcellular domains. Results: There were no differences in ERβ expression between male and female patients. High expression of ERβ was not a prognostic factor, but was significantly associated with stage IV disease in both tumor and stroma (P<0.001). In multivariable analysis, a high nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio of ERβ expression was significantly associated with shorter overall survival, based on expression in the tumor [hazard ratio (HR): 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.25–2.19; P<0.001] and in the stroma (HR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.16–2.12; P=0.003). Conclusions: These results suggest that subcellular localization of ERβ, but not absolute expression, is a prognostic factor in NSCLC.","['Enwere, E.K.', 'Dean, M.L.', 'Li, H.', 'D’Silva, A.', 'Bebb, D.G.']",10.21037/tlcr.2020.03.34
Gender-specific differences in care-seeking behaviour among lung cancer patients: a systematic review,"Background: In the literature, men are often described as unwilling to use healthcare services, whereas women as frequent users. We conducted a systematic literature review to examine the gender differences in healthcare utilisation of lung cancer patients. Our aim was to synthesise evidence to assess whether men and women utilise cancer diagnosis and treatments differently. Methods: The databases of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EBSCO Host, Ovid nursing, and Cochrane was systematically searched. We used pre-defined eligibility criteria to identify peer-reviewed published literature that reported healthcare use of lung cancer patients. Two reviewers independently screened the title, abstract, full texts and retrieved relevant data. Results: A total of 42 studies met the eligibility criteria from 1356 potential studies. In these studies, the most commonly measured healthcare utilisation is surgery (n = 19), followed by chemotherapy (n = 13). All the studies were from developed countries and had a higher percentage of male participants. Substantial evidence of heterogeneity in the use of treatments by gender were found. In relation to diagnosis interval and stage of cancer diagnosis, it was found that women had longer diagnostic intervals. Nonetheless, women tend to get diagnosed at an earlier stage. Furthermore, women had a higher probability of using inpatient cancer-care services and surgical treatments. Conversely, men had greater risks of readmission after surgery and longer length of stay. Lastly, there were no significant gender differences in the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Conclusion: This study synthesised evidence of disparities in the use of lung cancer treatments based on gender in developed countries, with no evidence available from least-developed and developing countries. Further studies are required to understand this gender-specific inequality and to design interventions to improve the survival rate of lung cancer patients.","['Rana, R.H.', 'Alam, F.', 'Alam, K.', 'Gow, J.']",10.1007/s00432-020-03197-8
Evaluating Potential Racial Inequities in Low-dose Computed Tomography Screening for Lung Cancer,"Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the US, and significant racial disparities exist in lung cancer outcomes. For example, Black men experience higher lung cancer incidence and mortality rates than their White counterparts. New screening recommendations for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) promote earlier detection of lung cancer in at-risk populations and can potentially help mitigate racial disparities in lung cancer mortality if administered equitably. Yet, little is known about the extent of racial differences in uptake of LDCT. Objective: To evaluate potential racial disparities in LDCT screening in a large community-based cancer center in central North Carolina. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of the initial patients undergoing LDCT in a community-based cancer center (n = 262). We used the Pearson chi-squared test to assess potential racial disparities in LDCT screening. Results: Study results suggest that Black patients may be less likely than White patients to receive LDCT screening when eligible (χ2 = 51.41, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Collaboration among healthcare providers, researchers, and decision makers is needed to promote LDCT equity.","['Richmond, J.', 'Mbah, O.M.', 'Dard, S.Z.', 'Jordan, L.C.', 'Cools, K.S.', 'Samuel, C.A.', 'Khan, J.M.', 'Manning, M.A.']",10.1016/j.jnma.2019.10.002
Gender and Regional Differences in Lung Cancer Mortality in Brazil,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This was a population-based ecological with data of deaths from the Mortality Information System. The objective of this study was to analyze the temporal trends of mortality induced by bronchi and lung cancer in Brazil and its geographical regions between 2001 and 2015 and secondly to calculate predictions for 2016-2030. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mortality trends were analyzed by the Joinpoint regression and calculation of predictions was used the Nordpred software. RESULTS: There was a reduction trend in lung cancer mortality among Brazilian men living in South and Southeast regions of Brazil. However, there was an increasing trend in lung cancer mortality among Brazilian women living in Northeast, Southeast, and South regions of Brazil. When comparing the last observed period and the last foreseen period for males, it is expected an increase of 12.86% in the number of deaths, justified mainly by the change in population structure, with a reduction in the risk of death by the disease. For women, the expected increase is 26.22%, justified both by population structure, and the increased risk of deaths from the disease. The higher rates will be observed in the southern region of the country, for both sexes. CONCLUSION: The mortality induced by lung and bronchial cancer in Brazil was unevenly distributed. However lung cancer incidence had a reducing trend, the mortality caused following it was increased among men. For women, the rates are rising, and until 2030, the mortality load will continue to rise for both..","['Costa, S.N.L.', 'Fernandes, F.C.G.M.', 'Santos, C.A.D.', 'Souza, D.L.B.', 'Barbosa, I.R.']",10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.4.919
The relation between psychological profiles and quality of life in patients with lung cancer,"Objective: Previous studies in patients with lung cancer examined the association between psychological factors with quality of life (QoL), as well as the association between psychological factors with sociodemographic and medical characteristics. However, knowledge about the impact of combinations of psychological characteristics on QoL is still lacking. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify psychological profiles, covering multiple psychological factors. Additionally, the association between these profiles with QoL and with sociodemographic and medical characteristics was explored. Methods: Patients with lung cancer (n = 130, mean age = 68.3 ± 8.6 years; 49% men) completed questionnaires focusing on sociodemographic information, anxiety and depressive symptoms (HADS), coping (COPE-easy), perceived social support (PSSS), and QoL (WHOQOL-BREF). Medical information was extracted from patients’ medical records. A step-3 latent profile analysis was performed to identify the psychological profiles. Multinomial logit models were used to explore the medical and sociodemographic correlates of the profiles and the relation with QoL. Results: Four psychological profiles were identified as follows: (1) anxious, extensive coping repertoire (33%); (2) depressive, avoidant coping (23%); (3) low emotional symptoms, active/social coping (16%); and (4) low emotional symptoms, limited coping repertoire (29%). QoL in profile 1 (QoL = 6.59) was significantly different from QoL in profile 3 (QoL = 8.11, p =.001) and profile 4 (QoL = 7.40, p =.01). QoL in profile 2 (QoL = 6.43) was significantly different from QoL in profile 3 (QoL = 8.11, p =.003) and profile 4 (QoL = 7.40, p =.02). Regarding QoL, no other significant differences were found. Sociodemographic and medical characteristics were not distinctive for the profiles (all p values >.05). Conclusion: Determining psychological profiles of patients with lung cancer in an early stage provides information that may be helpful in aligning care with patients’ unique needs, as it will help in more adequately selecting those patients who are in need of psychological screening and/or psychological treatment as compared with determining scores on single psychological factors.","['van Montfort, E.', 'de Vries, J.', 'Arts, R.', 'Aerts, J.G.', 'Kloover, J.S.', 'Traa, M.J.']",10.1007/s00520-019-04923-w
Ethnic inequities in life expectancy attributable to smoking,"AIM: To determine the contribution of smoking-related deaths to the life expectancy gap in both Māori and Pacific people compared with non-Māori/non-Pacific people in New Zealand. METHODS: Death registration and population data between 2013 and 2015 were used to calculate life expectancy. To determine the contribution of smoking to the life expectancy gap, population attributable fractions for all causes of death where smoking is a casual risk factor were calculated using age- and ethnic-specific smoking data from the 2013 New Zealand Census and relative risk estimates from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II. Population attributable fractions were applied to all deaths registered in New Zealand for the 2013-15 period to estimate the number of deaths attributable to tobacco smoking. The life expectancy gap was decomposed using the Arriaga method. The gap was decomposed both overall and by specific smoking attributable causes of death. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2015 an estimated 12,421 (13.4% of all deaths) were attributable to smoking. Nearly one in four (22.6%) deaths among Māori were attributable to smoking (2,199 out of 9,717 deaths) and nearly one in seven (13.8%) among Pacific people (512 out of 3,720 deaths). Among non-Māori/non-Pacific people, one in eight (12.3%) deaths were attributable to smoking (9,710 out of 78,759 deaths). Higher rates of smoking attributable mortality were responsible for 2.1 years of the life expectancy gap in Māori men, 2.3 years in Māori women, 1.4 years in Pacific men and 0.3 years among Pacific women. Cancers of the trachea, bronchus and lung, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ischaemic heart disease were the leading smoking attributable causes of death contributing to the gap. CONCLUSION: Smoking is an important preventable risk factor contributing to ethnic inequities in life expectancy for Māori men and women, and Pacific men. Dramatic declines in smoking-attributable deaths can be achieved by reducing smoking prevalence rates. Preventing smoking initiation and increasing cessation rates must remain a top priority for the Ministry of Health and District Health Boards. Smokefree initiatives should be reoriented to be Tiriti o Waitangi (Treaty of Waitangi) compliant and better meet the needs of Māori and Pacific people who smoke. Addressing the residual risk in ex-smokers through equitable early diagnosis and treatment of smoking-related conditions will further assist a more rapid closing of life expectancy gaps for Māori men and women and Pacific men. The next five years provide the opportunity to demonstrate commitment to achieving a smokefree Aotearoa for all: an aspiration, based on the current trajectory, which is most probably out of reach.","['Walsh, M.', 'Wright, K.']",
Disparities in the use of stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of lung cancer brain metastases: a SEER-Medicare study,"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a costly procedure used to irradiate disease tissue while sparing healthy tissue, ideally limiting the side effects of treatment. SRS is frequently used in the setting of lung cancer, which is associated with greater rates of BM, though its cost may lead to potentially inequitable use across patient populations. This study investigates potential disparities in the use of SRS to treat Medicare patients. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End-Results cancer registry data for patients diagnosed between the years 2010 and 2012 were examined to identify lung cancer patients diagnosed with BM at the same time as their primary cancer (SBM). Medicare claims for SRS were identified; the odds of having SRS claims and hazards of mortality associated with those odds were examined with respect to various clinical and demographic characteristics. Of 74,142 Medicare-enrolled patients diagnosed with lung cancer, 9192 were diagnosed with SBM and 3259 of those patients received SRS. Adjusting for clinical and demographic characteristics, males with SBM had 0.85 times the odds of SRS compared to females with SBM. Black patients and those of other race had significantly lower odds of evidence of SRS compared to WNH patients. SRS may not be delivered equitably among Medicare patients. Males and minority patients may have decreased odds of SRS and worse survival compared to female and WNH patients, respectively.","['Ascha, M.S.', 'Funk, K.', 'Sloan, A.E.', 'Kruchko, C.', 'Barnholtz-Sloan, J.S.']",10.1007/s10585-019-10005-2
Survival disparities following surgery among patients with different histological types of non-small cell lung cancer,"Objectives: Clinical decisions for NSCLC patients are often based on TNM stage, which does not account for different histological subtype. Whether histological subtype affects survival still remains unclear. The main objective of this study was to determine the extent to which the survival outcomes of patients with early-stage NSCLC differ by histological subtype. Material and methods: Retrospective cohort study of SEER data base. Patients with stage IA and IB NSCLC that underwent surgery with lymph node dissection were included. The primary outcome was the time to death. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify risk factors associated with overall survival (OS). The secondary outcome was the time to death from lung cancer. A Cox model and a Fine-Gray subdistribution hazards model in which death from causes other than lung cancer was considered a competing risk event were used to identify risk factors for death from lung cancer. Results: Analysis of the SEER database identified 28,584 NSCLC patients, of whom 19,750 (69 %) had adenocarcinoma and 8834 (31 %) had squamous cell carcinoma. In the multivariate for OS, older age (p < 0.001), male gender (p < 0.001), pneumonectomy (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p < 0.001), squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0.001) not being Hispanic or Asian were associated with increased risk of death. In the competing risk model, older age (p < 0.001), male gender (p < 0.001), pneumonectomy (p < 0.001), larger tumor size (p < 0.001), and squamous cell carcinoma (p < 0.001) were was associated with an increased risk of death from lung cancer. Conclusion: This study suggests that among patients with stage I NSCLC, those with squamous histology have a higher risk of mortality than those with adenocarcinoma histology taking into account competing risks.","['Grosu, H.B.', 'Manzanera, A.', 'Shivakumar, S.', 'Sun, S.', 'Noguras Gonzalez, G.', 'Ost, D.E.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2019.12.007
Effect of a Patient Decision Aid on Lung Cancer Screening Decision-Making by Persons Who Smoke: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: Lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography lowers lung cancer mortality but has potential harms. Current guidelines support patients receiving information about the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening during decision-making. Objective: To examine the effect of a patient decision aid (PDA) about lung cancer screening compared with a standard educational material (EDU) on decision-making outcomes among smokers. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized clinical trial was conducted using 13 state tobacco quitlines. Current and recent tobacco quitline clients who met age and smoking history eligibility for lung cancer screening were enrolled from March 30, 2015, to September 12, 2016, and followed up for 6 months until May 5, 2017. Data analysis was conducted between May 5, 2017, and September 30, 2018. Interventions: Participants were randomized to the PDA video Lung Cancer Screening: Is It Right for Me? (n = 259) or to EDU (n = 257). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were preparation for decision-making and decisional conflict measured at 1 week. Secondary outcomes included knowledge, intentions, and completion of screening within 6 months of receiving the intervention measured by patient report. Results: Of 516 quit line clients enrolled, 370 (71.7%) were younger than 65 years, 320 (62.0%) were female, 138 (26.7%) identified as black, 47 (9.1%) did not have health insurance, and 226 (43.8%) had a high school or lower educational level. Of participants using the PDA, 153 of 227 (67.4%) were well prepared to make a screening decision compared with 108 of 224 participants (48.2%) using EDU (odds ratio [OR], 2.31; 95% CI, 1.56-3.44; P <.001). Feeling informed about their screening choice was reported by 117 of 234 participants (50.0%) using a PDA compared with 66 of 233 participants (28.3%) using EDU (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.72-3.79; P <.001); 159 of 234 participants (68.0%) using a PDA compared with 110 of 232 (47.4%) participants using EDU reported being clear about their values related to the harms and benefits of screening (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.60-3.51; P <.001). Participants using a PDA were more knowledgeable about lung cancer screening than participants using EDU at each follow-up assessment. Intentions to be screened and screening behaviors did not differ between groups. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, a PDA delivered to clients of tobacco quit lines improved informed decision-making about lung cancer screening. Many smokers eligible for lung cancer screening can be reached through tobacco quit lines.","['Volk, R.J.', 'Lowenstein, L.M.', 'Leal, V.B.', 'Escoto, K.H.', 'Cantor, S.B.', 'Munden, R.F.', 'Rabius, V.A.', 'Bailey, L.', 'Cinciripini, P.M.', 'Lin, H.', 'Housten, A.J.', 'Luckett, P.G.', 'Esparza, A.', 'Godoy, M.C.', 'Bevers, T.B.']",10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.20362
"Educational level, management and outcomes in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC): A population-based cohort study","Objectives: To examine if educational status is associated with outcome in patients with Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). The study also investigated differences in patterns of management (lead times and treatment intensity) between educational levels. Material and methods: This nationwide cohort study was based on data from Lung Cancer Data Base Sweden (LCBaSe) generated by record linkages between the Swedish National Lung Cancer Register and several other population-based registers. Educational level was categorized by number of years of schooling: low (≤ 9 years), medium (10–12 years) and high (≥ 13 years). Risk of death expressed as hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence interval (CI) were estimated in multi-variable analyses adjusted for age, sex, disease stage at diagnosis, household size and performance status (PS). Analyses stratified by sex and stage were also performed. Results and conclusions: The study population encompassed 4256 patients with an SCLC diagnosis between 2002 and 2011. Higher education was associated with a significantly lower risk of death in univariable and multivariable models. The univariable HR comparing high to low level of education was 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.75–0.93), an estimate that was attenuated following adjustments (HR 0.88; 95 % CI: 0.80–0.98). Compared to men with a low level of education, the risk of death was significantly lower in men with a high education; HR 0.84 (95 % CI: 0.73–0.98). In Limited Disease (LD), the prognosis was significantly better in both men and women with high compared low education (HR 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.58–0.98).

Spatial variation in lung cancer mortality and related men–women disparities in Iran from 2011 to 2014,"Purpose: Lung cancer is considered as a common cause of cancer mortality. The disease represents the second and third causes of deaths from cancer among Iranian women and men, respectively. The present study aimed to evaluate the spatial variations in relative risk of lung cancer mortality in Iran and its relation to common risk factors between men and women and specific risk factors among women. Methods: In this ecological study, the lung cancer mortality data were analyzed in Iran during 2011–2014. Besag, York, and Mollie’s (BYM) model and shared component model (SCM) were used to compare the spatial variations of the relative risk of lung cancer mortality by applying OpenBUGS version 3.2.3 and R version 3.6.1. Results: The median age for death due to lung cancer in Iran is 74 years. During 2011–2014, the age-standardized lung cancer mortality rates among men and women were 12 and 5 per 100,000 individuals, respectively. In addition, almost similar spatial patterns were observed for both men and women. Further, risk factors, which are shared between men and women, were considered as the main cause of variation of lung cancer mortality relative risk in the regions under study for both men and women. The highest impact of the women-specific risk factors was estimated in northeastern and southwestern of the country while the lowest was related to Gilan province in northern part of Iran. Conclusion: Based on the spatial pattern, lung cancer risk factors are at relatively high levels in most parts of Iran, especially in the northwest of the country. Regarding the women, the high-risk regions were considerably extended. Further, the highest concentration of the specific risk factors among women was observed in the eastern, central, and southwestern parts. The smoking effect, and the second-smoking effect and environmental pollutions could play more significant roles for men and women, respectively.","['Ghasemi, S.', 'Mahaki, B.', 'Dreassi, E.', 'Aghamohammadi, S.']",10.2147/CMAR.S247178
Real-world evidence: Multicenter efficacy and toxicity analysis of nintedanib with docetaxel as second-line treatment in Mexican patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma,"PURPOSE The LUME-Lung 1 study has brought consistent evidence of the effective use of nintedanib in lung adenocarcinoma as a second line of treatment; however, differences among ethnicities have been found in some studies. METHODS This was a retrospective review among 21 medical centers of 150 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma, included in a compassionate use program of nintedanib from March 2014 to September 2015. The current study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of nintedanib in combination with docetaxel in the Mexican population, using progression-free survival rate and the best objective response to treatment by RECIST 1.1 as a surrogate of effectiveness. In addition, we examined the toxicity profile of our study population as a secondary end point. RESULTS After exclusion criteria, only 99 patients met the criteria for enrollment in the current study. From the total study population, 53 patients (53.5%) were male and 46 (46.5%) were female, with an average age of 60 years and stage IV as the most prevalent clinical stage at the beginning of the compassionate use program. A total of 48 patients (48.5%) had partial response; 26 (26.3%), stable disease; 4 (4%), complete response; and 16 (16.2%), progression; and 5 (5%) were nonevaluable. We found a median progression-free survival of 5 months (95% CI, 4.3 to 5.7 months). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were fatigue (14%) and diarrhea (13%). CONCLUSION Nintedanib, as part of a chemotherapy regimen, is an effective option with an acceptable toxicity profile for advanced lung adenocarcinoma after first-line treatment progression.","['Rodríguez-Cid, J.R.', 'Campos-Gomez, S.', 'García-Montes, V.', 'Magallanes-Maciel, M.', 'Flores-Mariñelarena, R.R.', 'Fernández-Garibay, V.M.', 'González-Espinoza, I.R.', 'Ceja-García, J.P.', 'Cázarez-Price, J.C.', 'Martínez-Barrera, L.', 'Barriguete-Parra, L.', 'Zuloaga-Fernandez, C.J.', 'Kuri-Exsome, R.', 'Suárez-García, D.', 'Gonzalez-Villanueva, J.I.', 'Flores-Anaya, N.', 'Acevedo-Delgado, J.A.', 'Astorga-Ramos, A.M.', 'Gerson-Cwilich, R.', 'Villalobos-Prieto, A.', 'Rodríguez-Silva, C.', 'Noriega-Iriondo, M.F.', 'Vázquez-Cortés, L.', 'Perales-Rodríguez, E.', 'Acosta-Espinoza, A.', 'Perez-Lozano, Y.', 'Capdeville-García, D.', 'Alatorre-Alexander, J.A.']",10.1200/JGO.19.00330
Social support as a moderator between the perception of the disease and stress level in lung cancer patients,"Introduction. Many studies attempt to explain the relationship between living in highly industrialized societies and the development of various diseases among people. Nowadays, the incidence of lung cancer is increasing worldwide. This is a highly stressful situation, both psychologically and physically. The study investigates the variable of social support and its moderating role between stress level and the perception of the disease among patients diagnosed with lung cancer. Objective. The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis that there is a correlation between the subjective appraisal of one’s disease and the level of stress, as well as the hypothesis that social support is a moderator between the perception of the disease and stress level in patients diagnosed with lung cancer. Materials and method. The study involved 97 respondents diagnosed with lung cancer – 50 men and 47 women. The following methods were used for the study: the Disease-Related Appraisals Scale, the Disease-Related Social Support Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale. Socio-demographic data were also collected. Results. The results show that informational support may increase the level of perceived stress in lung cancer patients. It can be concluded that social support fulfils its moderating function in forming a stress response to cancer. A statistically significant moderating effect was observed of social support on the relationship between the appraisal of one’s disease as harmful and the stress level. Conclusions. The research findings demonstrate that social support plays a substantial role. It is important to diagnose the individual specific needs of lung cancer patients concerning the support they need.","['Poręba-Chabros, A.', 'Mamcarz, P.', 'Jurek, K.']",10.26444/aaem/123099
Differential Efficacy of Anti-VEGF Antibodies Based on Sex and Race in a Diverse Cohort of Advanced Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Objectives:Bevacizumab with chemotherapy improved overall survival (OS) in the E4599 trial in metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NS-NSCLC). A meta-analysis demonstrated an OS benefit with bevacizumab only in a subset of nonwhite patients. We explored the efficacy of antivascular endothelial growth factor antibodies (AVA) in a diverse cohort.Materials and Methods:Patients with advanced (stage IIIB/IV, American Joint Committee Cancer 7th edition) recurrent or metastatic NS-NSCLC diagnosed January 2006 to December 2017 at a single medical center were included. Survival analysis was performed with log-rank testing of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Univariate models were constructed, and significant variables, age, sex, race were incorporated into a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. Data analysis was performed on SAS.Results:A total of 171 patients, 80 were treated with AVA and 91 were untreated. Median age: 63 years, 55% females, 19% non-Hispanic whites, 44% blacks and 32% Hispanic whites; median 40 pack-years of smoking; 11.7% had sensitizing epidermal growth factor receptor mutations. Patients who received AVA had a survival benefit (26.6 vs. 19 mo, P=0.025). Adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, epidermal growth factor receptor mutations, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status and number of metastases; AVA therapy was associated with improved OS (adjusted hazard ratio=0.62; P=0.049). In a subgroup analysis, females had survival benefit with AVA (median survival: 29.1 vs. 14.2 mo, log-rank P=0.02) which was significant in the adjusted model (adjusted hazard ratio=0.52; P=0.049).Conclusions:In a diverse cohort of patients with advanced NS-NSCLC, a survival benefit was confirmed with AVA. The greatest magnitude of benefit was in blacks and non-Hispanic whites. A significant survival benefit was limited to female patients.","['Sukrithan, V.', 'Barbaro, A.', 'Chergui, A.', 'Ko, B.', 'Lin, J.', 'Cheng, H.', 'Goel, S.']",10.1097/COC.0000000000000628
Results of low-dose computed tomography as a regular health examination among Xinjiang hospital employees,"Background and purpose: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening in Eastern China has found that the previously considered “low-risk population”, that is, young women who do not smoke, have a higher detection rate of lung cancer. Whether this phenomenon also exists in Western China, and how to determine the target receivers for LDCT is still unknown. This study analyzed the data of the screening of some residents in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and provided a practical basis for promoting practice of LDCT. Methods: From Apr. 2020 to May 2020, all employees of the Eighth Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University voluntarily underwent free LDCT screenings as one of their annual health examinations, including retired employees. All suspicious imaging data were reviewed by the multidisciplinary team of chest diseases in the hospital, and recommendations for clinical diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up were given. Results: A total of 1 039 employees underwent LDCT, including 739 (71.1%) women, with a median age of 35 years (19-90 years). Among the participants, 698 (67.2%) were of Han ethnicity. LDCT showed 351 (33.8%) cases with lung abnormalities. The detection rate was positively correlated with age (P<0.001). Among these abnormal cases, 86 (8.3%) were solid nodules, 12 (1.2%) were ground-glass opacities (GGO), 141 (13.5%) were calcified lesions, and 112 (10.8%) cases of other benign lesions. One case of lung cancer was finally diagnosed, and he was a male smoker. Two cases underwent surgical resection. Pathological diagnosis confirmed that one solid nodule was tuberculosis, and one GGO (maximum diameter was 3 cm) was an inflammatory lesion. In the other two cases of GGO with a diameter greater than 8 mm, the lesions were found to shrink during the half-year follow-up CT scan, considering inflammatory lesions as well. No evidence of malignancy had been found in the remaining patients until this manuscript was complete. Conclusion: LDCT as a regular health examination detects a considerable proportion of healthy population with lung abnormalities. How it can be used as a routine screening method among Xinjiang residents needs further investigation.","['Zhang, Y.', 'Liu, D.', 'Zhu, C.', 'Chang, W.', 'Yan, X.', 'Jin, Y.', 'Zhang, Y.', 'Che, Y.', 'Chen, H.']",10.19401/j.cnki.1007-3639.2020.12.007
Rising geographic inequality in mortality in the United States,"Objectives: To examine trends in inequality in life expectancy and age-specific death rates across 40 US spatial units from 1990 to 2016. Methods: We use multiple cause-of-death data from vital statistics to estimate measures of inequality in mortality across metropolitan status and geographic region. We consider trends for 5-year age intervals and examine inequality in cause-specific mortality. Results: For both sexes, spatial inequality in life expectancy and all-cause mortality above age 25 rose between 2002-04 and 2014–16. During this period, the standard deviation in life expectancy at birth increased by 19% for males and by 44% for females. Areas that had higher life expectancy at the beginning of the period enjoyed larger gains in life expectancy. Especially noteworthy are divergent trends between large central metropolitan areas on the coasts and non-metropolitan areas in Appalachia and the South. Spatial inequality in mortality from lung cancer/respiratory diseases rose substantially, particularly for older women. Spatial inequality in mortality from the combination of drug overdose, alcohol use, and suicide increased at ages 30–34, but declined at ages 50–54 and 70–74. Inequality in mortality from circulatory diseases, the largest cause of death, grew for some groups, particularly 30-34 year-old women. Mortality from screenable cancers, an indicator of the performance of medical systems, showed relatively little spatial disparity during the period. Conclusions: Spatial inequality in life expectancy at birth and adult mortality has increased in recent decades.","['Vierboom, Y.C.', 'Preston, S.H.', 'Hendi, A.S.']",10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100478
Race/ethnicity and lung cancer survival in the United States: a meta-analysis,"Purpose: Lung cancer mortality has been shown to vary by race and ethnicity in cancer registries; however, studies often do not account for smoking status. We sought to summarize the independent contribution of race and ethnicity to survival in US lung cancer patients, accounting for important variables including smoking status. Methods: PubMed was used to identify 1,877 potentially eligible studies of which 27 were included. Studies were excluded if they did not account for age, race and/or ethnicity, and smoking status. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were conducted using the reported adjusted hazard ratios (HR) of Hispanic ethnicity and Asian and African-American race compared to Non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) on overall survival in lung cancer. Results: Hispanic ethnicity and Asian race were associated with decreased adjusted risk of death (Hispanic: Nstudies = 5, Nsubjects = 108,810, HR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.90–1.00; Asian: Nstudies = 6, Nsubjects = 128,950, HR = 0.86, 95% CI 0.81–0.90). The results were similar when excluding studies of solely never-smokers. There was no significant difference in survival between African-American and white race after adjustment (Nstudies = 10, Nsubjects = 131,378, HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.96–1.01). Other prognostic factors were female gender (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.87–0.89), unmarried status (HR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.04–1.11), ever-smoking status (HR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.08–1.15), having comorbidities (HR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.24–1.56), and treatment receipt (surgery: HR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.32–0.34; radiation: HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.85–0.88; chemotherapy: HR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.63–0.65). Conclusions: Even after adjustment for clinical factors and smoking status, Hispanics and Asians experienced improved survival compared to NHWs. Future studies are needed to elucidate the drivers of these survival disparities.","['Klugman, M.', 'Xue, X.', 'Hosgood, H.D.']",10.1007/s10552-019-01229-4
"Race and sex differences in patient provider communication and awareness of lung cancer screening in the health information National Trends Survey, 2013–2017","Despite demonstrated reduction in lung cancer mortality, lung cancer screening uptake has been low. We investigated differences in discussions with physicians about lung cancer screening and awareness using repeated cross-sectional data from three cycles [4.2 (2013); 4.4(2014)and 5.1 (2017)]of the Health Information National Trends Survey. We included 4207 respondents age 55 to 80 who responded to this question: ‘In the past year, have you talked with your doctor about having a test to check for lung cancer?’. We used logistic regression accounting for complex sample weighting to generate multivariable adjusted odds ratios (ORs)and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The proportion of participants reporting lung cancer screening discussions was low and did not increase over time. In the most recent cycle, 15.7% of current smokers and 9.9% of former smokers said they had discussed screening. Compared to males, females were 32% less likely to report a lung cancer screening discussion (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.50–0.93)and the association was strongest among non-Hispanic White females. Estimates were similar among never (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.43–1.20), current (OR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.39–1.36), and former (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.40–1.10)smokers. Females were 32% less likely than males to be aware of a lung cancer screening test (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.47–0.99)and this association was strongest for non-Hispanic Black females (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.19–0.77). Too few providers have discussed lung cancer screening with potentially eligible patients, particularly female patients. Further research is needed to evaluate possible causes for this finding.","['Warner, E.T.', 'Lathan, C.S.']",10.1016/j.ypmed.2019.05.001
LDCT lung cancer screening eligibility and use of CT scans for lung cancer among sexual minorities,"Objective: To compare eligibility for lung cancer screening and receipt of a CT scan for lung cancer among sexual minorities. Methods: Secondary data analysis of cross-sectional data from older U.S. adults in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey during the 2017 cycle (n = 20,685). Results: Rates of eligibility for low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) were roughly twice as high among sexual minorities than among heterosexuals (21.1% vs. 11.7%). The odds of gay men and lesbian women indicating eligibility for LDCT screening were four to five times higher when compared to their heterosexual peers. No statistically significant differences were found between sexual minorities and heterosexuals with respect to having a CT scan for lung cancer in the past year. Conclusions: There are potential sexual-identity-related disparities in the utilization of lung cancer screening among eligible smokers. Interventions are needed to increase awareness and uptake of lung cancer screening in order to detect and manage this common form of cancer in the U.S.","['Veliz, P.', 'Matthews, A.K.', 'Arslanian-Engoren, C.', 'Evans-Polce, R.J.', 'Lee, J.G.L.', 'Boyd, C.J.', 'Hughes, T.', 'McCabe, V.V.', 'McCabe, S.E.']",10.1016/j.canep.2019.03.009
Potential Influence on Clinical Trials of Long-Term Survivors of Stage IV Non-small cell Lung Cancer,"Background: New, effective treatments have resulted in long-term survival for small subgroups of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, knowledge of long-term survivor frequency and characteristics prior to modern therapies is lacking. Methods: Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) patients with stage IV NSCLC diagnosed from 1991 to 2007 and followed through 2012 were dichotomized by survival time into the 10% who lived 21 months or longer (long-term survivors) vs the remaining 90% and compared with participants in a representative clinical trial of molecular profiling and targeted therapies (CUSTOM). Results: Among the 44 387 SEER patients, the 10% identified as long-term survivors were distinguishable from the remaining 90% by younger age, female sex, Asian race, adenocarcinoma histology, tumor grade, tumor site, and surgery. From 1991–1994 to 2003–2007, median survival increased by 6 months from 30 to 36 months among long-term survivors but by only 1 month from 3 to 4 months among the remaining 90%. Among the 165 participants in the CUSTOM trial, 54% met our SEER criterion of long-term survival by living for 21 months or longer. Conclusions: Among SEER patients with stage IV NSCLC, long-term survivors had a median survival approximately 10 times that of the remaining 90%. Long-term survivors accounted for more than one-half of the participants in a representative clinical trial. Caution is required when extrapolating the outcomes of participants in clinical trials to patients in routine clinical practice.","['Davis, J.S.', 'Prophet, E.', 'Peng, H.-L.', 'Lee, H.Y.', 'Tidwell, R.S.S.', 'Lee, J.J.', 'Thomas, A.', 'Szabo, E.', 'Chang, S.']",10.1093/JNCICS/PKZ010
Timing of treatment in small-cell lung cancer,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor survival and rapid doubling time. Current practice is to treat SCLC as soon as possible but evidence on appropriate timing of treatment from diagnosis (TTD) is lacking. This is a retrospective analysis of SCLC patients from the 2012 to 2015 Kentucky Cancer Registry. Data collected included age at diagnosis, stage, gender, race, insurance and treatment. Factors and survival associated with TTD were identified with logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. Among the 2992 SCLC patients, 2371 (79%) of SCLC patients were treated with one or more treatment modalities. Among treated patients, 93% received chemotherapy ± radiation with the mean TTD of 18 days. Most patients (80%) have TTD of ≤ 4 weeks with 33% treated within 1 week, 20% 1–2 weeks, and 27% 2–4 weeks from diagnosis. Delay in treatment (TTD > 4 weeks) was less in stage III and IV disease (odds ratio: 0.33 and 0.27 respectively, p < 0.01) but not significantly associated with age, race, gender, and insurance. One and two-year survival of patients with TTD ≤ 4 weeks was significantly worse when compared to > 4 weeks (hazard ratio = 1.43, 95% CI 1.2–1.6, p < 0.01; HR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.3–1.6, p < 0.01 respectively). These results show a trend toward better survival with late treatment of SCLC. Therefore, a general urgency to treat SCLC needs to be re-evaluated with consideration of patients needing more optimization before treatment. Further studies are needed to better clarify the appropriate timing of treatment from diagnosis in SCLC and who will benefit from early versus late treatment.","['Bhandari, S.', 'Pham, D.', 'Pinkston, C.', 'Oechsli, M.', 'Kloecker, G.']",10.1007/s12032-019-1271-3
Disparities in the Treatment and Outcome of Stage I Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer in the 21st Century,"Racial disparities are historically profound and affect outcomes in early stage non–small-cell lung cancer. We aimed to explore if recent advances in radiotherapy and surgery have improved epidemiological differences in outcomes related to race.

Lung cancer screening patient–provider discussion: Where do we stand and what are the associated factors?,"Objective: The primary objective of this study was to estimate the percentage of individuals possibly eligible for lung cancer screening that report having discussed screening with a health care provider. The secondary objective was to investigate the associated factors of having patient–provider lung cancer screening discussion. Methods: Data from the Health Information National Trends Survey 2017 were used (n = 3217). Lung cancer screening eligibility was based on the criteria utilized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Gender, race, educational attainment, health insurance coverage, and usual source of health care were covariates. Current or former smokers ages 55–77 (n = 706) were considered potentially eligible for lung cancer screening (dependent variable). Results: Only 12.24% of individuals potentially eligible for lung cancer screening report prior discussion regarding lung cancer screening with a health care provider. Being eligible for lung cancer screening based on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services eligibility criteria was positively associated with the odds of a patient–provider lung cancer screening discussion (odds ratio = 3.95, 95% confidence interval = 2.48–6.30). Unlike gender, race, education, or insurance coverage, a usual source of health care was positively associated with a patient–provider screening discussion (odds ratio = 2.48, 95% confidence interval = 1.31–4.70). Conclusion: Individuals potentially eligible for lung cancer screening are more likely to have screening discussions with a health care provider. Having a usual source of health care may increase the odds of such a discussion, while patients are not discriminated based on race, gender, education, and insurance coverage. However, the relatively low rate (12.24%) of reported patient–provider lung cancer screening discussion indicates that significant barriers still remain.","['Chalian, H.', 'Khoshpouri, P.', 'Iranmanesh, A.M.', 'Mammarappallil, J.G.', 'Assari, S.']",10.1177/2050312119854265

Preoperative thoracic muscle area on computed tomography predicts long-term survival following pneumonectomy for lung cancer,"Objectives: To assess the prognostic role of thoracic muscle as quantified on preoperative computed tomography (CT) for the estimation of overall survival (OS) following pneumonectomy. Methods: Muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) at the level of the fifth (T5) and eighth (T8) thoracic vertebra was measured on CT scans of consecutive patients with lung cancer prior to pneumonectomy. We stratified patients into high and low muscle groups using the gender-specific median of muscle CSA as separator and estimated associations of muscle CSA and OS using the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index (includes age), forced expiratory volume in the first second as a % of predicted, sex, race, smoking status, tumour stage and prior lung cancer treatment was performed. Results: A total of 128 patients were included (61.0 ± 10.6 years of age, mean body mass index of 26.9 kg/m2, 55.5% men). The T8 level showed fewer artefacts and strong correlation with the T5 level (Pearson's rho = 0.904). T8 CSA was therefore used for subsequent analyses. Mean T8 CSA was 118.5 cm2 (median 115.3 cm2) in men and 75.2 cm2 (median 74.0 cm2) in women. During a median follow-up of 23.6 months (interquartile range 39.3), 65 patients (50.8%) died, of whom 41 were in the low muscle group. The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly longer OS in the high muscle group (log-rank P = 0.02). Multivariable analysis showed an independent association of muscle CSA and OS (P = 0.02) with a hazard ratio of 0.80 (confidence interval 0.67-0.98) per 10-cm2 increment. Conclusions: Thoracic muscle is independently associated with long-term overall survival following pneumonectomy for lung cancer and may contribute to refined survival estimates in this population.","['Troschel, F.M.', 'Kuklinski, M.W.', 'Knoll, S.J.', 'Best, T.D.', 'Muniappan, A.', 'Gaissert, H.A.', 'Fintelmann, F.J.']",10.1093/icvts/ivy280
Impact of the homogeneous and heterogeneous risk factors on the incidence and survival outcome of bone metastasis in NSCLC patients,"Purpose: Bone metastases (BM) is reported as the most frequent distant metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the risk factors for the incidence and prognosis of BM patients in NSCLC have not been extensively elucidated. This study aimed to find risk factors to predict BM patients’ morbidity and survival outcome in NSCLC. Methods: 63,505 patients of NSCLC in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 were used to analyze risk factors for developing BM by conducting multivariable logistic regression. Of these patients, 6152 and 5664 BM patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 were selected to investigate predictive factors for BM overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: There were overall 7486 (11.79%) BM patients in NSCLC. The homogeneous risk factors for BM patients’ morbidity and survival outcome included male, higher T stage, lymph node involvement, poor differentiation grade, brain metastases, and liver metastases. Married status, adenocarcinoma type and lung metastases were positively correlated with BM incidence, while older age, white race, unmarried status, and SCC and other NSCLC types could predict poor OS and CSS of BM in NSCLC. Conclusions: The homogeneous and heterogeneous risk factors for morbidity and survival outcome of BM patients could help physicians in more precise and individualized screening and therapies for BM patients in NSCLC.","['Song, Q.', 'Shang, J.', 'Zhang, C.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Wu, X.']",10.1007/s00432-018-02826-7
"Racial and socioeconomic disparities in cancer-related knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors in Indiana","Background: This statewide survey examined differences in cancer-related knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors between racial and socioeconomic groups in select counties in Indiana. Methods: A stratified random sample of 7,979 people aged 18–75 who lived in one of 34 Indiana counties with higher cancer mortality rates than the state average, and were seen at least once in the past year in a statewide health system were mailed surveys. Results: Completed surveys were returned by 970 participants, yielding a 12% response rate. Black respondents were less likely to perceive they were at risk for cancer and less worried about getting cancer. Individuals most likely to perceive that they were unlikely to get cancer were more often black, with low incomes (less than $20,000) or high incomes ($50,000 or more), or less than a high school degree. Black women were greater than six times more likely to be adherent to cervical cancer screening. Higher income was associated with receiving a sigmoidoscopy in the last 5 years and a lung scan in the past year. Those with the highest incomes were more likely to engage in physical activity. Both income and education were inversely related to smoking. Conclusions: Socioeconomic and racial disparities were observed in health behaviors and receipt of cancer screening. Black individuals had less worry about cancer. Impact: Understanding populations for whom cancer disparities exist and geographic areas where the cancer burden is disproportionately high is essential to decision-making about research priorities and the use of public health resources.","['Rawl, S.M.', 'Dickinson, S.', 'Lee, J.L.', 'Roberts, J.L.', 'Teal, E.', 'Baker, L.B.', 'Kianersi, S.', 'Haggstrom, D.A.']",10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0795
A system-based intervention to reduce Black-White disparities in the treatment of early stage lung cancer: A pragmatic trial at five cancer centers,"Background: Advances in early diagnosis and curative treatment have reduced high mortality rates associated with non-small cell lung cancer. However, racial disparity in survival persists partly because Black patients receive less curative treatment than White patients. Methods: We performed a 5-year pragmatic, trial at five cancer centers using a system-based intervention. Patients diagnosed with early stage lung cancer, aged 18-85 were eligible. Intervention components included: (1) a real-time warning system derived from electronic health records, (2) race-specific feedback to clinical teams on treatment completion rates, and (3) a nurse navigator. Consented patients were compared to retrospective and concurrent controls. The primary outcome was receipt of curative treatment. Results: There were 2841 early stage lung cancer patients (16% Black) in the retrospective group and 360 (32% Black) in the intervention group. For the retrospective baseline, crude treatment rates were 78% for White patients vs 69% for Black patients (P < 0.001); difference by race was confirmed by a model adjusted for age, treatment site, cancer stage, gender, comorbid illness, and income-odds ratio (OR) 0.66 for Black patients (95% CI 0.51-0.85, P = 0.001). Within the intervention cohort, the crude rate was 96.5% for Black vs 95% for White patients (P = 0.56). Odds ratio for the adjusted analysis was 2.1 (95% CI 0.41-10.4, P = 0.39) for Black vs White patients. Between group analyses confirmed treatment parity for the intervention.

Prevalence of psychosocial distress in cancer patients across 55 North American cancer centers,"Routine distress screening in United States oncology clinics has been mandatory since 2015. Objective: This study was the first to assess distress in a geographically diverse sample of cancer patients following mandated distress screening implementation by oncology social workers. Methods: Sites were self-selected via social workers who applied to participate in the Association of Oncology Social Work’s Project to Assure Quality Cancer Care, advertised through their social media outlets and conference. Electronic screening records were collected from 55 cancer treatment centers in the United States and Canada. Cases required cancer diagnoses and Distress Thermometer (DT) scores to be included. Distress rates and rates by age, sex, cancer type, and ethnicity were examined. Results: Of 4664 cases, 46% (2157) experienced significant distress (DT score ≥ 4). Being female, age 40-59, and having diagnoses of pancreatic or lung cancer was associated with increased likelihood of distress. Half of cases experience clinically-significant distress, though this need was not evenly distributed across patient or cancer types. Conclusion: Identifying those at risk for distress may help inform optimal resource allocation. Methods to address needs of distressed patients in cases of limited resources are discussed.","['Carlson, L.E.', 'Zelinski, E.L.', 'Toivonen, K.I.', 'Sundstrom, L.', 'Jobin, C.T.', 'Damaskos, P.', 'Zebrack, B.']",10.1080/07347332.2018.1521490
Surgical Disparities Among Patients With Stage I Lung Cancer in the National Lung Screening Trial,"Background: Low-dose CT scan reduces lung cancer mortality in high-risk patients fit to undergo surgical resection. Racial disparities in resection of lung cancer in nonscreening populations are well described. We describe surgical resection patterns of patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and examine whether racial disparities exist among blacks. Methods: We identified all NLST participants with clinical stage I NSCLC. Covariates included demographics, smoking history, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and timing of cancer detection. Using logistic regression, we assessed resection rates of blacks vs whites. Results: Among 752 patients with clinical stage I disease, 692 patients (92%) underwent resection. Unadjusted surgical resection rates for white men, white women, black men, and black women were 92%, 91%, 61%, and 90%, respectively. In adjusted analyses, compared with white men, black men had a 28% lower risk (relative risk, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-0.99) of undergoing surgery; however, white women and black women underwent surgery at comparable rates as white men. The odds of undergoing limited resection instead of full resection were 70% greater in white women than white men (OR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.08-2.65). Conclusions: Our study shows that disparities in the surgical treatment of lung cancer persist, even among NLST participants who were considered fit to undergo thoracic surgery.

Population morbidity in elderly lung cancer patients from Poland with specific trends in elderly women,"Introduction: Lung cancer remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Poland and globally. The objective of the study was to assess lung cancer incidence among elderly patients in Poland, including data for urban and rural populations, with trend analysis between 2008 and 2012. Material and methods: Differences between lung cancer prevalence in the Polish population aged 65 years or older were assessed with respect to province, gender, and rural vs. urban areas during the 2008-2012 period. Data were extracted from the Polish National Health Authority and Statistical Bureau databases. Results: Lung cancer morbidity among the elderly increased by 14.05% in urban areas but only by 4.01% in rural areas. A 22.41% overall increase was noted in the elderly female population, compared to a 7.29% increase among men aged 65 years and over. Regional differences in morbidity were observed. Conclusions: The rationale behind the differences is likely to be multi-factorial. A change in risk factor exposure in the past is probably now being reflected in lung cancer morbidity. The difference between sexes can potentially be regarded as an unfortunate side-effect of increasing female empowerment. Urban vs. rural, as well as regional, variances are probably due to a multitude of factors, including differences in socio-economic status.","['Śliwczyński, A.', 'Kalinka, E.', 'Sierocka, A.', 'Iltchev, P.', 'Kowalski, D.', 'Marczak, M.']",10.5114/pm.2019.90811
T790M mutation determined by liquid biopsy in lung cancer after tyrosine kinase inhibitors,"Introduction: Progress in the diagnostic-therapeutic approach in lung cancer has been achieved thanks to the knowledge of tumor heterogeneity and optimization in molecular analysis. Material and methods: Cases of patients with lung cancer from 2015 to 2018 were reviewed, recording sociodemographic, clinical, molecular and result variables of T790M. The results were expressed in measures of central tendency and Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed. Results: Of the total of patients with lung cancer in INER, it was found that 93.74% (n = 704) were non-small cell lung cancer, 86% (n = 606) were adenocarcinomas and 42.63% (n = 191) had sensitive mutated EGFR. A total of 30 samples were sent to T790M determination, being positive at 50%. The majority were female, never smokers. The median progression-free survival was 13 months. Conclusion: In this study we found a resistance frequency acquired in T790M higher than in other countries. These allow to know the importance of the determination of T790M in patients who receive inhibitors of tyrosine kinase in front of the progression offering a second line in time of impact on the prognosis.","['Sánchez-Ríos, C.P.', 'Rodríguez-Cid, J.R.', 'Martínez-Barrera, L.M.', 'Flores-Soto, M.D.R.', 'Santillán-Doherty, P.', 'Alatorre-Alexander, J.A.']",10.35366/NT194C
"Association between age, deprivation and specific comorbid conditions and the receipt of major surgery in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in England: A population-based study","Introduction We investigated socioeconomic disparities and the role of the main prognostic factors in receiving major surgical treatment in patients with lung cancer in England. Methods Our study comprised 31 351 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer in England in 2012. Data from the national population-based cancer registry were linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and National Lung Cancer Audit data to obtain information on stage, performance status and comorbidities, and to identify patients receiving major surgical treatment. To describe the association between prognostic factors and surgery, we performed two different analyses: One using multivariable logistic regression and one estimating cause-specific hazards for death and surgery. In both analyses, we used multiple imputation to deal with missing data. Results We showed strong evidence that the comorbidities 'congestive heart failure', 'cerebrovascular disease' and 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease' reduced the receipt of surgery in early stage patients. We also observed gender differences and substantial age differences in the receipt of surgery. Despite accounting for sex, age at diagnosis, comorbidities, stage at diagnosis, performance status and indication of having had a PET-CT scan, the socioeconomic differences persisted in both analyses: More deprived people had lower odds and lower rates of receiving surgery in early stage lung cancer. Discussion Comorbidities play an important role in whether patients undergo surgery, but do not completely explain the socioeconomic difference observed in early stage patients. Future work investigating access to and distance from specialist hospitals, as well as patient perceptions and patient choice in receiving surgery, could help disentangle these persistent socioeconomic inequalities.","['Belot, A.', 'Fowler, H.', 'Njagi, E.N.', 'Luque-Fernandez, M.-A.', 'Maringe, C.', 'Magadi, W.', 'Exarchakou, A.', 'Quaresma, M.', 'Turculet, A.', 'Peake, M.D.', 'Navani, N.', 'Rachet, B.']",10.1136/thoraxjnl-2017-211395
Epidemiology of lung cancer in China,"The incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in China, have significantly increased in recent years, and present geographic and gender differences as a result of diversity in lifestyles and socioeconomic development. A series of attribute risk analyses have shown that factors such as smoking, air pollution, and occupational factors are all related to lung cancer. Behavioral intervention, such as smoking cessation and screening, could effectively reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality.","['Cao, M.', 'Chen, W.']",10.1111/1759-7714.12916
Benefits of surgery in the multimodality treatment of stage IIB-IIIC small cell lung cancer,"Surgery combined with chemotherapy/radiotherapy is recommended for early stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC); however, the role of surgery in the multimodality treatment of advanced disease remains controversial. The clinical data of patients between 2000 and 2015 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The surgery group included 998 patients with stage IIB-IIIC. A matched non-surgery group (n = 2994) was generated by propensity score matching. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used for survival analyses. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify significant prognostic factors. After matching, there were no significant differences between the two groups in race, age, sex, T classification, N classification, TNM stage, marital status, primary sites, and origin record NAACCR Hispanic Identification Algorithm (NHIA). The surgery group showed better overall survival and cancer-specific survival than the non-surgery group. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that therapy methods, age, sex, T classification, and N classification were independent prognostic predictors for stage IIB-IIIC SCLC (all P < 0.05). Stratified analyses showed that survival outcomes favored surgery in any age groups, men and women, any T classification except T3, and N0-2 but not N3 compared with non-surgical treatment. The survival differences favored surgery in stage IIB and IIIA SCLC, although they were not significant in stage IIB and IIIC SCLC. Therefore, surgery was associated with improved survival in stage IIB and IIIA SCLC, but not in stage IIIB and IIIC SCLC.","['Yang, Y.', 'Yuan, G.', 'Zhan, C.', 'Huang, Y.', 'Zhao, M.', 'Yang, X.', 'Wang, S.', 'Lin, Z.', 'Zheng, S.', 'Lu, T.', 'Guo, W.', 'Wang, Q.']",10.7150/jca.31202
"Demographic, Social, and Behavioral Determinants of Lung Cancer Perceived Risk and Worries in a National Sample of American Adults; Does Lung Cancer Risk Matter?","Background: Perceived risk and worries of developing cancer are important constructs for cancer prevention. Many studies have investigated the relationship between health behaviors and subjective risk perception. However, factors correlated with lung cancer risk perception and worries in individuals more susceptible to lung cancer have rarely been investigated. Objective: To determine demographic, social, and behavioral determinants of cancer perceived risk and worries and to explore heterogeneities in these associations by the level of lung cancer risk in a nationally representative sample of American adults. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, data came from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) 2017, which included a 2277 representative sample of American adults. Smoking status, cancer perceived risk, cancer worries, age, gender, race, education, income, and insurance status were measured. We ran structural equation models (SEMs) for data analysis. Results: ""Ever smoker"" status was associated with higher cancer perceived risk (b = 0.25; 95% CI = 0.05⁻0.44, p = 0.013) and worries (b = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.18⁻0.50, p < 0.001), suggesting that ""ever smokers"" experience higher levels of cancer perceived risk and worries regarding cancer, compared to ""never smokers"". Other factors that correlate with cancer perceived risk and worries were race, age, income, and insurance status. Blacks demonstrated less cancer perceived risk and worry (b = -0.98, 95% CI = -1.37⁻0.60, p < 0.001) in both low and high risk lung cancer groups. However, the effects of social determinants (income and insurance status) and age were observed in low but not high risk group. Conclusions: Determinants of cancer perceived risk and worries vary in individuals depending on the level of lung cancer risk. These differences should be considered in clinical practice and policy makings with the goal of improving participation rates in lung cancer screening programs.","['Chalian, H.', 'Khoshpouri, P.', 'Assari, S.']",10.3390/medicina54060097
"The incidence and mortality of lung cancer in China, 2014","Objective: To estimate lung cancer incidence and mortality in China using population-based cancer registry data in 2014 collected by National Central Cancer Registry of China (NCCRC). Methods: 449 cancer registries submitted cancer registry data in 2014. All datasets were evaluated and 339 registries' data which met the quality control criteria of NCCRC were analyzed. Numbers of new lung cancer cases and deaths were estimated using calculated incidence and mortality rates and corresponding national population stratified by areas, sexes and age groups. The standard population of Chinese census in 2000 and world Segi' s population were applied to calculate age-standardized incidence and mortality rates in China and worldwide, respectively. Results: A total of 781, 500 new lung cancer cases were diagnosed in 2014. The crude incidence rate was 57.13 per 100 000 and the age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) were 36.71 per 100 000 and 36.63 per 100 000, respectively. The cumulative incidence rate (0-74 years old) was 4.50%. Lung cancer was the most common cancer in male (ASIRW: 50.04 per 100 000) and the second most common cancer in female (ASIRW: 23.63 per 100 000). The incidence rates were slightly similar in urban areas and in rural areas (ASIRW: 36.64 per 100 000 vs 36.56 per 100 000). A total of 626 400 lung cancer deaths were reported. The crude mortality rate was 45.80 per 100 000 and the age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) were 28.49 per 100 000 and 28.31 per 100 000, respectively. The cumulative mortality rate (0-74 years old) was 3.32%. Lung cancer was the most common cause of cancer deaths both in male (ASMRW: 40.21 per 100 000) and female (ASMRW: 16.88 per 100 000). The mortality rate was slightly higher in rural areas than in urban areas (ASMRW: 28.63 per 100 000 vs 28.04 per 100 000). Both lung cancer incidence and mortality rates increased with age, and the peak age was 80-84 years group. Conclusions: The disease burden of lung cancer is heavy in China. Efficient national health policies and prevention and control strategies against lung cancer should be promoted.","['Sun, K.X.', 'Zheng, R.S.', 'Zeng, H.M.', 'Zhang, S.W.', 'Zou, X.N.', 'Gu, X.Y.', 'Xia, C.F.', 'Yang, Z.X.', 'Li, H.', 'Chen, W.Q.', 'He, J.']",10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-3766.2018.11.002
Differences in cancer survival by sex: a population-based study using cancer registry data,"Purpose: Few large-scale studies have investigated sex differences in cancer survival and little is known about their temporal and age-related patterns. Methods: We used cancer registry data for first primary cancers diagnosed between 1982 and 2015 in Victoria, Australia. Cases were followed until the end of 2015 through linkage to death registries. Differences in survival were assessed for 25 cancers using the Pohar-Perme estimator of net survival and the excess mortality rate ratio (EMRR) adjusting for age and year of diagnosis. Results: Five-year net survival for all cancers combined was lower for men (47.1%; 95% CI 46.9–47.4) than women (52.0%; 95% CI 51.7–52.3); EMRR 1.13 (95% CI 1.12–1.14; p < 0.001). A survival disadvantage for men was observed for 11 cancers: head and neck, esophagus, colorectum, pancreas, lung, bone, melanoma, mesothelioma, kidney, thyroid, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In contrast, women had lower survival from cancers of the bladder, renal pelvis, and ureter. For the majority of cancers with survival differences, the EMRR decreased with increasing age at diagnosis; for colorectal, esophageal, and kidney cancer, the EMRR increased with time since diagnosis. Conclusion: Identifying the underlying reasons behind sex differences in cancer survival is necessary to address inequalities, which may improve outcomes for men and women.","['Afshar, N.', 'English, D.R.', 'Thursfield, V.', 'Mitchell, P.L.', 'Te Marvelde, L.', 'Farrugia, H.', 'Giles, G.G.', 'Milne, R.L.']",10.1007/s10552-018-1079-z
"Global, regional, and national cancer incidence, mortality, years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life-years for 29 cancer groups, 1990 to 2016 a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study global burden of disease cancer collaboration","IMPORTANCE: The increasing burden due tocancer and other noncommunicable diseases poses a threat to human development, which has resulted in global political commitments reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) GlobalAction Plan on Non-Communicable Diseases. To determine if these commitments have resulted in improved cancer control, quantitative assessments of the cancer burden are required. OBJECTIVE: To assess the burden for 29 cancer groups over time to provide a framework for policy discussion, resource allocation, and research focus. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were evaluated for 195 countries and territories by age and sex using the Global Burden of Disease study estimation methods. Levels and trends were analyzed over time, as well as by the Sociodemographic Index (SDI). Changes in incident cases were categorized by changes due to epidemiological vs demographic transition. FINDINGS: In 2016, there were 17.2 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.9 million deaths. Cancer cases increased by 28% between 2006 and 2016. The smallestincrease was seen in high SDI countries. Globally, population aging contributed 17%; population growth, 12%; and changes in age-specific rates, -1% to this change. The most common incident cancer globally for men was prostate cancer (1.4 million cases). The leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs was tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (1.2 million deaths and 25.4 million DALYs). For women, the most common incident cancer and the leading cause ofcancer deaths and DALYs was breast cancer (1.7 million incident cases, 535 000 deaths, and 14.9 million DALYs). In 2016, cancer caused 213.2 million DALYs globally for both sexes combined. Between 2006 and 2016, the average annual age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 130 of 195 countries or territories, and the average annual age-standardized death rates decreased within that timeframe in 143 of 195 countries or territories. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Large disparities exist between countries in cancer incidence, deaths, and associated disability. Scaling up cancer prevention and ensuring universal access to cancer care are required for health equity and to fulfill the global commitments for noncommunicable disease and cancer control.","['Fitzmaurice, C.', 'Akinyemiju, T.F.', 'Al Lami, F.H.', 'Alam, T.', 'Alizadeh-Navaei, R.', 'Allen, C.', 'Alsharif, U.', 'Alvis-Guzman, N.', 'Amini, E.', 'Anderson, B.O.', 'Aremu, O.', 'Artaman, A.', 'Asgedom, S.W.', 'Assadi, R.', 'Atey, T.M.H.', 'Avila-Burgos, L.', 'Awasthi, A.', 'Saleem, H.O.', 'Barac, A.', 'Bennett, J.R.', 'Bensenor, I.M.', 'Bhakta, N.', 'Brenner, H.', 'Cahuana-Hurtado, L.', 'Castañeda-Orjuela, C.A.', 'Catalá-López, F.', 'Choi, J.-Y.J.', 'Christopher, D.J.', 'Chung, S.-C.', 'Curado, M.P.', 'Dandona, L.', 'Dandona, R.', 'Das Neves, J.', 'Dey, S.', 'Dharmaratne, S.D.', 'Doku, D.T.', 'Driscoll, T.R.', 'Dubey, M.', 'Ebrahimi, H.', 'Edessa, D.', 'El-Khatib, Z.', 'Endries, A.Y.', 'Fischer, F.', 'Force, L.M.', 'Foreman, K.J.', 'Gebrehiwot, S.W.', 'Gopalani, S.V.', 'Grosso, G.', 'Gupta, R.', 'Gyawali, B.', 'Hamadeh, R.R.', 'Hamidi, S.', 'Harvey, J.', 'Hassen, H.Y.', 'Hay, R.J.', 'Hay, S.I.', 'Heibati, B.', 'Hiluf, M.K.', 'Horita, N.', 'Hosgood, H.D.', 'Ilesanmi, O.S.', 'Innos, K.', 'Islami, F.', 'Jakovljevic, M.B.', 'Johnson, S.C.', 'Jonas, J.B.', 'Kasaeian, A.', 'Kassa, T.D.', 'Khader, Y.S.', 'Khan, E.A.', 'Khan, G.', 'Khang, Y.-H.', 'Khosravi, M.H.', 'Khubchandani, J.', 'Kopec, J.A.', 'Kumar, G.A.', 'Kutz, M.', 'Lad, D.P.', 'Lafranconi, A.', 'Lan, Q.', 'Legesse, Y.', 'Leigh, J.', 'Linn, S.', 'Lunevicius, R.', 'Majeed, A.', 'Malekzadeh, R.', 'Malta, D.C.', 'Mantovani, L.G.', 'McMahon, B.J.', 'Meier, T.', 'Melaku, Y.A.', 'Melku, M.', 'Memiah, P.', 'Mendoza, W.', 'Meretoja, T.J.', 'Mezgebe, H.B.', 'Miller, T.R.', 'Mohammed, S.', 'Mokdad, A.H.', 'Moosazadeh, M.', 'Moraga, P.', 'Mousavi, S.M.', 'Nangia, V.', 'Nguyen, C.T.', 'Nong, V.M.', 'Ogbo, F.A.', 'Olagunju, A.T.', 'Mahesh, P.A.', 'Park, E.-K.', 'Patel, T.', 'Pereira, D.M.', 'Pishgar, F.', 'Postma, M.J.', 'Pourmalek, F.', 'Qorbani, M.', 'Rafay, A.', 'Rawaf, S.', 'Rawaf, D.L.', 'Roshandel, G.', 'Safiri, S.', 'Salimzadeh, H.', 'Sanabria, J.R.', 'Milicevic, M.M.S.', 'Sartorius, B.', 'Satpathy, M.', 'Sepanlou, S.G.', 'Shackelford, K.A.', 'Shaikh, M.A.', 'Sharif-Alhoseini, M.', 'She, J.', 'Shin, M.-J.', 'Shiue, I.', 'Shrime, M.G.', 'Sinke, A.H.', 'Sisay, M.', 'Sligar, A.', 'Sufiyan, M.B.', 'Sykes, B.L.', 'Tabarés-Seisdedos, R.', 'Tessema, G.A.', 'Topor-Madry, R.', 'Tran, T.T.', 'Tran, B.X.', 'Ukwaja, K.N.', 'Vlassov, V.V.', 'Vollset, S.E.', 'Weiderpass, E.', 'Williams, H.C.', 'Yimer, N.B.', 'Yonemoto, N.', 'Younis, M.Z.', 'Murray, C.J.L.', 'Naghavi, M.']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2018.2706
Risk factors for severe diarrhea with an afatinib treatment of non-small cell lung cancer: A pooled analysis of clinical trials,"Afatinib is an effective therapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but it is associated with a relatively high incidence of severe diarrhea. The association between pre-treatment candidate predictors (age, sex, race, performance status, renal function, hemoglobin, and measures of body mass) and severe (grade ≥ 3) diarrhea was evaluated using logistic regression with pooled individual participant data from seven clinical studies. A risk score was developed based on the count of major risk factors. Overall, 184 of 1151 participants (16%) experienced severe diarrhea with use of afatinib. Body weight, body mass index, and body surface area all exhibited a prominent non-linear association where risk increased markedly at the lower range (p < 0.005). Low weight (<45 kg), female sex, and older age (≥60 years) were identified as major independent risk factors (p < 0.01). Each risk factor was associated with a two-fold increase in the odds of severe diarrhea, and this was consistent between individuals commenced on 40 mg or 50 mg afatinib. A simple risk score based on the count of these risk factors identifies individuals at lowest and highest risk (C-statistic of 0.65). Risk of severe diarrhea for individuals commenced on 40 mg afatinib ranged from 6% for individuals with no risk factors to 33% for individuals with all three risk factors.","['Hopkins, A.M.', 'Nguyen, A.-M.', 'Karapetis, C.S.', 'Rowland, A.', 'Sorich, M.J.']",10.3390/cancers10100384
Cost-effectiveness of a low-dose computed tomography screening programme for lung cancer in New Zealand,"Objectives: The cost-effectiveness of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer is uncertain. This study estimated the health gains, costs (net health system, and including ‘unrelated’) and cost-effectiveness of biennial LDCT screening among 55–74 years olds with a smoking history of at least 30 pack years, and (if a former smoker) having quit within last 15 years, in New Zealand. Methods: We used a macrosimulation stage shift model with New Zealand-specific lung cancer incidence rates and intervention parameters from the National Lung Screening Trial, a health system perspective, and a lifetime horizon for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs discounted at 3% per annum. We also examined heterogeneity by gender, ethnicity (Māori (indigenous population) versus non-Māori), age and current versus ex-smoking status. Results and Conclusion: We estimated 0.037 QALYs gained (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.024–0.053) per eligible participant, at a cost of US$3606 ($2689–4681). The overall incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$104,000 per QALY gained (95% UI US$59,000–US$175,000). The cost-effectiveness varied moderately by socio-demographics, with the ‘best’ ICER being US$52,000 for 70–74 year old Māori females and the ‘worst’ ICER being US$142,000 for 55–59 year old non-Māori females. The ICER varied little by current smoking status, due to higher competing mortality risk limiting QALY gains for current smokers. The two scenarios that lowered the ICER the most were increasing the screening uptake to 100% (ICER = US$50,000 per QALY), and improving the sensitivity (from 93.8%–98%) and specificity (from 73.4%–95%) of the screening test (ICER = US$42,000 per QALY). Based on a threshold of GDP per capita per QALY gained (i.e. US$30,000), LDCT screening for lung cancer is unlikely to be cost-effective in New Zealand for any sociodemographic group.","['Jaine, R.', 'Kvizhinadze, G.', 'Nair, N.', 'Blakely, T.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2018.08.004
Afatinib in advanced pretreated non-small-cell lung cancer— A Canadian experience,"Background Afatinib, an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (egfr tki), is approved for first-line therapy in advanced EGFR mutation–positive non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc) and has previously demonstrated activity after failure of chemotherapy and reversible egfr tkis, with improved response and progression-free survival, compared with placebo. Outcomes in pretreated patients with advanced nsclc receiving afatinib through a Canadian special access program (sap) are reported here. Methods Patients with nsclc progressing after at least 1 line of chemotherapy and an egfr tki were eligible to enrol in the sap. Characteristics of patients from the two largest accruing Canadian centres were retrospectively reviewed, including demographics, disease and treatment data, and patient outcomes. Results The 53 patients who received afatinib (57% women, 51% never-smokers, 26% of East Asian ethnicity, and 66% with adenocarcinoma) had a median age of 59 years. EGFR mutations were documented in 25%, and EGFR wild-type in 8%. All patients had received prior egfr tki treatment, with 42% achieving a response. Patients took afatinib for a median of 2 months (range: 0–26 months); 17% required 1 or more dose reductions. Of 47 evaluable patients receiving afatinib, 10 experienced tumour shrinkage, and 11, stable disease. Median survival from afatinib initiation was 5 months (95% confidence interval: 2 months to 8 months). Grade 3 or greater diarrhea, rash, paronychia, and stomatitis were seen in 9%, 11%, 6%, and 4% of patients respectively. Conclusions In an unselected population of pretreated patients with advanced nsclc after tki failure, median survival with afatinib therapy was 5 months. Through a sap, afatinib demonstrated activity in clinical practice, with manageable toxicity.","['Ezeife, D.A.', 'Melosky, B.', 'Tudor, R.', 'Lin, S.', 'Lau, A.', 'Panzarella, T.', 'Leighl, N.B.']",10.3747/co.25.3914
Cancer incidence and mortality among ethnic German migrants from the former Soviet Union,"Germany is a country known for immigration. In 2015, 21% of the general population in Germany consisted of individuals with a migration background. This article focuses on cancer-specific incidence and mortality among one of the biggest migrant groups in Germany: the resettlers. Resettlers are ethnic Germans who mainly immigrated from the Russian federation and other countries of the former Soviet Union after its collapse in 1989. We investigated differences between resettlers and the general German population, regarding (i) incidence and mortality of malignant neoplasms, (ii) time trends of the corresponding incidence and mortality, and (iii) cancer stage at diagnosis. We provide data from two resettler cohorts covering an observation time of 20 years: one cohort on cancer incidence (N = 32,972), and another cohort on mortality (N = 59,390). Cancer-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for all malignant neoplasms combined and the most common cancer-sites were calculated between resettlers and the general German population. Time trend analyses using Poisson regression were performed to investigate the developments of SIRs and SMRs. To investigate differences in stage at diagnosis, logistic regression was performed, calculating Odds Ratios for condensed cancer stages. We observed higher incidence and mortality of stomach cancer [SIR (men) 1.62, 95%CI 1.17-2.19; SMR (men) 1.62, 95%CI 1.31-2.01; SIR (women) 1.32, 95%CI 0.86-1.94; SMR (women) 1.52, 95%CI 1.19-1.93] and higher mortality of lung cancer [SMR (men) 1.34, 95%CI 1.20-1.50] among resettlers compared to the general German population, but lower incidence and mortality of colorectal (both sexes), lung (women), prostate and female breast cancer. However, time trend analyses showed converging incidence risks of cause-specific incidence over time, whereas differences of mortality did not show changes over time. Results from logistic regression suggest that resettler men were more often diagnosed with advanced cancer stages compared to the Münster population. Our findings suggest that risk factor patterns of the most common cancer-sites among resettlers are similar to those observed within the Russian population. Such increases in prostate, colorectal and breast cancer incidence may be the consequence of improved detection measures, and/or the adaptation of resettlers to the German lifestyle.","['Kaucher, S.', 'Kajüter, H.', 'Becher, H.', 'Winkler, V.']",10.3389/fonc.2018.00378
Assessment of insomnia among Tunisian patients with lung cancer,"Introduction: Sleep disorders are relatively common in oncology. However, they have not been well studied and are often treated insufficiently. Aim: To assess the prevalence and severity of insomnia in lung cancer patients and evaluate the relationship between insomnia and certain clinical parameters. Methods: A cross-sectional study was undertaken of patients in Tunis with primary lung cancer. Socio-demographic and clinical data were obtained from the medical records Patients were then asked to answer questionnaires related to insomnia (ISI), depression-anxiety (HAD) and quality of life (QLQ-C30). Results: Fifty patients with lung cancer were included (46 men, 4 women). The average age was 59 ± 9 years. Insomnia was found in 24 patients (48%) and 60% of patients had depression. HAD was significantly higher in the insomniac patients (21.54 ± 8.96 vs. 9.81 ± 5.28, P < 0.0001). Similarly, the QLQ-C30 was significantly lower in these patients (41.24 ± 12.55 vs. 56 ± 16.88, P < 0.01). ISI was significantly correlated with HAD and QLQ-C30. Conclusion: Insomnia is common in patients with lung cancer. It is responsible for impaired quality of life and psychological distress. Diagnosis and management of insomnia in patients with lung cancer is therefore mandatory.","['Mjid, M.', 'Slim, A.', 'Hrizi, D.', 'Hedhli, A.', 'Cheikh Rouhou, S.', 'Ouahchi, Y.', 'Toujani, S.', 'Cherif, J.']",10.1016/j.rmr.2017.10.669
"Smoking, sex, and non–Small cell lung cancer: Steroid hormone receptors in tumor tissue (S0424)","Background: To what extent steroid hormones contribute to lung cancer in male and female never smokers and smokers is unclear. We examined expression of hormone receptors in lung tumors by sex and smoking. Methods: Patients with primary non–small cell lung cancer were recruited into an Intergroup study in the United States and Canada, led by SWOG (S0424). Tumors from 813 cases (450 women and 363 men) were assayed using immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor (ER)–a, ER-b, progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Linear regression was used to examine differences in expression by sex and smoking status. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate survival associated with the receptors. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: In ever smokers, postmenopause and oral contraceptive use were associated with lower nuclear ER-b (P ¼ .02) and total (nuclear þ cytoplasmic) PR expression (P ¼ .02), respectively. Women had lower cytoplasmic ER-a (regression coefficient [b], or differences in H-scores ¼ –15.8, P ¼ .003) and nuclear ER-b (b ¼ –12.8, P ¼ .04) expression than men, adjusting for age, race, and smoking. Ever smokers had both higher cytoplasmic ER-a (b ¼ 45.0, P < .001) and ER-b (b ¼ 25.9, P < .001) but lower total PR (b ¼ –42.1, P < .001) than never smokers. Higher cytoplasmic ER-a and ER-b were associated with worse survival (hazard ratio ¼ 1.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 1.15 to 2.58, and HR ¼ 1.59, 95% CI ¼ 1.08 to 2.33, respectively; quartiles 4 vs 1). Conclusions: Lower expression of nuclear ER-b in women supports the estrogen hypothesis in lung cancer etiology. Increasing cytoplasmic ER-a and ER-b and decreasing PR protein expression May be mechanisms whereby smoking disrupts hormone pathways.","['Cheng, T.-Y.D.', 'Darke, A.K.', 'Redman, M.W.', 'Zirpoli, G.R.', 'Davis, W.', 'Ondracek, R.P.', 'Bshara, W.', 'Omilian, A.R.', 'Kratzke, R.', 'Reid, M.E.', 'Molina, J.R.', 'Kolesar, J.M.', 'Chen, Y.', 'MacRae, R.M.', 'Moon, J.', 'Mack, P.', 'Gandara, D.R.', 'Kelly, K.', 'Santella, R.M.', 'Albain, K.S.', 'Ambrosone, C.B.']",10.1093/jnci/djx260
"Demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral associations with cancer screening among a homeless population","BACKGROUND: Although cancer incidence and mortality is declining, cancer remains among the leading causes of death in the United States. Research shows that cancer morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early detection. Yet, both cancer risks and screening behavior remain understudied in the homeless population. METHODS: Researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey of homeless individuals (n = 201). The analysis describes the demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral associations with cancer screenings and knowledge of the lung cancer screening recommendation. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 51.7 years (SD 13.6); the group was largely African American (77.3%) and male (67.9%). Among women, the breast and cervical cancer screening rates were 46.5% and 85.1%. Among men the prostate cancer screening rate was 34.2%. Among all participants, the colon cancer screening rate was 44%. Cancer risk behaviors were high. Lung cancer screening knowledge was low (23.0%). Some cancer screening behaviors were associated with age, income, health status, obesity, tobacco use, and physical activity. DISCUSSION: Despite higher cancer risk behaviors, knowledge and general participation rates for cancer screenings were below national benchmarks. CONCLUSION: To improve cancer survival among disparate populations, sustained community outreach is necessary to increase awareness of screening recommendations, identify high-risk individuals, and navigate them to resources.","['Williams, L.B.', 'McCall, A.', 'Looney, S.W.', 'Joshua, T.', 'Tingen, M.S.']",10.1111/phn.12391
Initial surgical experience following implementation of lung cancer screening at an urban safety net hospital,"Background: Safety net hospitals provide care mostly to low-income, uninsured, and vulnerable populations, in whom delays in cancer screening are established barriers. Socioeconomic barriers might pose important challenges to the success of a lung cancer screening program at a safety net hospital. We aimed to determine screening follow-up compliance, rates of diagnostic and treatment procedures, and the rate of cancer diagnosis in patients classified as category 4 by the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS 4). Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients enrolled in our multidisciplinary lung cancer screening program between March 2015 and July 2016. Demographics, smoking status, Lung-RADS score, and number of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and cancer diagnoses were captured. Results: A total of 554 patients were screened over a 16-month period. The mean patient age was 63 years (range, 47-85 years), and 60% were male. The majority (92%; 512 of 554) were classified as Lung-RADS 1 to 3, and 8% (42 of 554) were classified as Lung-RADS 4. Among the Lung-RADS 4 patients, 98% (41 of 42) completed their recommended follow-up; 29% (12 of 42) underwent a diagnostic procedure, for an overall diagnostic intervention rate of 2% (12 of 554). Eleven of these 12 patients had cancer, and 1 patient had sarcoidosis. The overall rate of surgical resection was 0.9% (5 of 554), and the rate of diagnostic intervention for noncancer diagnosis was 0.1% (1 of 554). Conclusions: Implementation of a multidisciplinary lung cancer screening program at a safety net hospital is feasible. Compliance with follow-up and interventional recommendations in Lung-RADS 4 patients was high despite anticipated social challenges. Overall diagnostic and surgical resection rates and interventions for noncancer diagnosis were low in our initial experience.","['Muñoz-Largacha, J.A.', 'Steiling, K.A.', 'Kathuria, H.', 'Charlot, M.', 'Fitzgerald, C.', 'Suzuki, K.', 'Litle, V.R.']",10.1016/j.jtcvs.2017.12.135
Differential effects of early palliative care based on the age and sex of patients with advanced cancer from a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Early palliative care interventions enhance patient outcomes, including quality of life, mood, and coping, but it remains unclear whether certain subgroups of patients are more likely to benefit from early palliative care. We explored whether age and sex moderate the improved outcomes seen with early palliative care. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial of 350 patients with advanced lung and non-colorectal gastrointestinal cancer. Patients received an early palliative care intervention integrated with oncology care or usual oncology care alone. We used linear regression to determine if age (older or younger than 65) and sex moderated the effects of the intervention on quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–General (FACT-G)), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)), and coping (Brief COPE) within lung and gastrointestinal subgroups. Results: At 24 weeks, younger patients with lung cancer receiving early palliative care reported increased use of active coping (B = 1.74; p = 0.02) and decreased use of avoidant coping (B = –0.97; p = 0.02), but the effects of early palliative care on these outcomes were not significant for older patients. Male patients with lung cancer assigned to early palliative care reported better quality of life (FACT-G: B = 9.31; p = 0.01) and lower depression scores (PHQ-9: B = –2.82; p = 0.02), but the effects of early palliative care on these outcomes were not significant for female patients. At 24 weeks, we found no age or sex moderation effects within the gastrointestinal cancer subgroup. Conclusion: Age and sex moderate the effects of early palliative care for patients with advanced lung cancer. Early palliative care may need to be tailored to individuals’ unique sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.","['Nipp, R.D.', 'El-Jawahri, A.', 'Traeger, L.', 'Jacobs, J.M.', 'Gallagher, E.R.', 'Park, E.R.', 'Jackson, V.A.', 'Pirl, W.F.', 'Temel, J.S.', 'Greer, J.A.']",10.1177/0269216317751893
Health-related quality of life in Chinese inpatients with lung cancer treated in large general hospitals: Across-sectional study,"Objective: In China, psychosocial problems of patients with cancer are under-recognised and undertreated in medical oncology practice. This study examined the health-related quality of life (QOL) in inpatients with lung cancer treated in large general hospitals and explored the demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors associated with QOL. Design: Cross-sectional study. Participants and setting Altogether, 148 inpatients with lung cancer were consecutively recruited from two large general hospitals in Tianjin, China. Main outcome measured QOL, pain intensity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and social support were assessed with WHO QOL Scale Brief Version, four-point Verbal Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Social Support Rating Scale, respectively. Results: Compared with the normative data for the Chinese general population, patients had significantly lower scores in physical (t=-25.860, p<0.001) and psychological (t=-18.225, p<0.001) QOL. Being unmarried (β=-2.471, 95% CI -4.908 to -0.034), poor economic status (β=-1.764, 95% CI -2.964 to -0.564), cancer metastasis (β=-1.328, 95% CI -2.632 to -0.024), poor performance status (β=-0.959, 95% CI -1.542 to -0.376), depression (β=-0.465, 95% CI -0.631 to -0.299), anxiety (β=-0.208, 95% CI -0.354 to -0.062) and low utilisation of social support (β=-0.344, 95% CI -0.577 to -0.111) were independently associated with poor physical QOL, while female gender (β=-1.494, 95% CI -0.649 to -2.339), less education years (β=-0.209, 95% CI -0.294 to -0.123), currently receiving chemotherapy (β=-1.536, 95% CI -3.051 to -0.021), small-cell cancer (β=-1.157, 95% CI -2.223 to -0.091), more intense pain (β=-0.535, 95% CI -0.919 to -0.151), poor performance status (β=-0.930, 95% CI -1.383 to -0.477), anxiety (β=-0.178, 95% CI -0.248 to -0.108) and inadequate subjective social support (β=-0.137, 95% CI -0.153 to -0.121) were independently associated with poor psychological QOL. Conclusions: Inpatients with lung cancer treated in Chinese large general hospitals have poorer QOL than the general population. Effective prevention and management of psychosocial problems are potentially effective to improve their QOL.","['Gu, W.', 'Xu, Y.-M.', 'Zhong, B.-L.']",10.1136/bmjopen-2017-019873
Trends in cancer survival by health insurance status in California from 1997 to 2014,"IMPORTANCE There have been substantial improvements in the early detection, treatment, and survival from cancer in the United States, but it is not clear to what extent patients with different types of health insurance have benefitted from these advancements. OBJECTIVE To examine trends in cancer survival by health insurance status from January 1997 to December 2014. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS California Cancer Registry (a statewide cancer surveillance system) data were used to estimate population-based survival by health insurance status in 3 calendar periods: January 1997 to December 2002, January 2003 to December 2008, and January 2009 to December 2014 with follow-up through 2014. Overall, 1 149 891 patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer, or melanoma in California were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Five-year all-cause and cancer-specific survival probabilities by insurance category and calendar period for each cancer site and sex; hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for each insurance category (none, Medicare, other public) compared with private insurance in each calendar period. RESULTS According to data from 1 149 891 patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer, or melanoma gathered from the California Cancer Registry, improvements in survival were almost exclusively limited to patients with private or Medicare insurance. For patients with other public or no insurance, survival was largely unchanged or declined. Relative to privately insured patients, cancer-specific mortality was higher in uninsured patients for all cancers except prostate, and disparities were largest from 2009 to 2014 for breast (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.45-2.03), lung (men: HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.31 and women: HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.15-1.50), and colorectal cancer (women: HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.62). Mortality was also higher for patients with other public insurance for all cancers except lung, and disparities were largest from 2009 to 2014 for breast (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.17-1.34), prostate (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.31), and colorectal cancer (men: HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08-1.23 and women: HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE After accounting for patient and clinical characteristics, survival disparities for men with prostate cancer and women with lung or colorectal cancer increased significantly over time, reflecting a lack of improvement in survival for patients with other public or no insurance. To mitigate these growing disparities, all patients with cancer need access to health insurance that covers all the necessary elements of health care, from prevention and early detection to timely treatment according to clinical guidelines.","['Ellis, L.', 'Canchola, A.J.', 'Spiegel, D.', 'Ladabaum, U.', 'Haile, R.', 'Gomez, S.L.']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.3846
"Pragmatic trial of a multidisciplinary lung cancer care model in a community healthcare setting: Study design, implementation evaluation, and baseline clinical results","Background: Responsible for 25% of all US cancer deaths, lung cancer presents complex care-delivery challenges. Adoption of the highly recommended multidisciplinary care model suffers from a dearth of good quality evidence. Leading up to a prospective comparative-effectiveness study of multidisciplinary vs. serial care, we studied the implementation of a rigorously benchmarked multidisciplinary lung cancer clinic. Methods: We used a mixed-methods approach to conduct a patient-centered, combined implementation and effectiveness study of a multidisciplinary model of lung cancer care. We established a co-located multidisciplinary clinic to study the implementation of this care-delivery model. We identified and engaged key stakeholders from the onset, used their input to develop the program structure, processes, performance benchmarks, and study endpoints (outcome-related process measures, patient- and caregiver-reported outcomes, survival). In this report, we describe the study design, process of implementation, comparative populations, and how they contrast with patients within the local and regional healthcare system. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02123797. Results: Implementation: The multidisciplinary clinic obtained an overall treatment concordance rate of 90% (target > 85%). Satisfaction scores were high, with > 95% of patients and caregivers rating themselves as being ""very satisfied"" with all aspects of care from the multidisciplinary team (patient/caregiver response rate > 90%). The Reach of the multidisciplinary clinic included a higher proportion of minority patients, more women, and younger patients than the regional population. Comparative effectiveness: The comparative effectiveness trial conducted in the last phase of the study met the planned enrollment per statistical design, with 178 patients in the multidisciplinary arm and 348 in the serial care arm. The multidisciplinary cohort had older age and a higher percentage of racial minorities, with a higher proportion of stage IV patients in the serial care arm. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a comprehensive implementation of a multidisciplinary model of lung cancer care, which will advance the science behind implementing this much-advocated clinical care model.","['Smeltzer, M.P.', 'Rugless, F.E.', 'Jackson, B.M.', 'Berryman, C.L.', 'Faris, N.R.', 'Ray, M.A.', 'Meadows, M.', 'Patel, A.A.', 'Roark, K.S.', 'Kedia, S.K.', 'DeBon, M.M.', 'Crossley, F.J.', 'Oliver, G.', 'McHugh, L.M.', 'Hastings, W.', 'Osborne, O.', 'Osborne, J.', 'Ill, T.', 'Ill, M.', 'Jones, W.', 'Lee, H.K.', 'Signore, R.S.', 'Fox, R.C.', 'Li, J.', 'Robbins, E.T.', 'Ward, K.D.', 'Klesges, L.M.', 'Osarogiagbon, R.U.']",10.21037/tlcr.2018.01.02
Lung cancer and socioeconomic status in a pooled analysis of case-control studies,"Background: An association between low socioeconomic status (SES) and lung cancer has been observed in several studies, but often without adequate control for smoking behavior. We studied the association between lung cancer and occupationally derived SES, using data from the international pooled SYNERGY study. Methods: Twelve case-control studies from Europe and Canada were included in the analysis. Based on occupational histories of study participants we measured SES using the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status (ISEI) and the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC). We divided the ISEI range into categories, using various criteria. Stratifying by gender, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by unconditional logistic regression, adjusting for age, study, and smoking behavior. We conducted analyses by histological subtypes of lung cancer and subgroup analyses by study region, birth cohort, education and occupational exposure to known lung carcinogens. Results: The analysis dataset included 17,021 cases and 20,885 controls. There was a strong elevated OR between lung cancer and low SES, which was attenuated substantially after adjustment for smoking, however a social gradient persisted. SES differences in lung cancer risk were higher among men (lowest vs. highest SES category: ISEI OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.61-2.09); ESeC OR 1.53 (95% CI 1.44-1.63)), than among women (lowest vs. highest SES category: ISEI OR 1.54 (95% CI 1.20-1.98); ESeC OR 1.34 (95% CI 1.19-1.52)). Conclusion: SES remained a risk factor for lung cancer after adjustment for smoking behavior.

"Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer survival: The contribution of tumor, sociodemographic, institutional, and neighborhood characteristics","Purpose Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival in the United States are well documented, but the underlying causes are not well understood. We quantified the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California. Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival disparities accounting for 24% of disparities in breast cancer, 24% in prostate cancer, and 16% to 30% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients. The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it explained only 15% to 40% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and access to health care are important contributing factors.","['Ellis, L.', 'Canchola, A.J.', 'Spiegel, D.', 'Ladabaum, U.', 'Haile, R.', 'Gomez, S.L.']",10.1200/JCO.2017.74.2049
"Impact of national cancer policies on cancer survival trends and socioeconomic inequalities in England, 1996-2013: Population based study","Objective To assess the effectiveness of the NHS Cancer Plan (2000) and subsequent national cancer policy initiatives in improving cancer survival and reducing socioeconomic inequalities in survival in England. Design Population based cohort study. Setting England. Population More than 3.5 million registered patients aged 15-99 with a diagnosis of one of the 24 most common primary, malignant, invasive neoplasms between 1996 and 2013. Main outcome measures Age standardised net survival estimates by cancer, sex, year, and deprivation group. These estimates were modelled using regression model with splines to explore changes in the cancer survival trends and in the socioeconomic inequalities in survival. Results One year net survival improved steadily from 1996 for 26 of 41 sex-cancer combinations studied, and only from 2001 or 2006 for four cancers. Trends in survival accelerated after 2006 for five cancers. The deprivation gap observed for all 41 sex-cancer combinations among patients with a diagnosis in 1996 persisted until 2013. However, the gap slightly decreased for six cancers among men for which one year survival was more than 65% in 1996, and for cervical and uterine cancers, for which survival was more than 75% in 1996. The deprivation gap widened notably for brain tumours in men and for lung cancer in women. Conclusions Little evidence was found of a direct impact of national cancer strategies on one year survival, and no evidence for a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival. These findings emphasise that socioeconomic inequalities in survival remain a major public health problem for a healthcare system founded on equity.","['Exarchakou, A.', 'Rachet, B.', 'Belot, A.', 'Maringe, C.', 'Coleman, M.P.']",10.1136/bmj.k764
Quality of life of inpatients with lung cancer and related influencing factors,"Objective To investigate the quality of life of inpatients with lung cancer and its influencing factors. Methods A total of 120 inpatients with lung cancer in Department of Respiratory Medicine of Changhai Hospital of Navy Medical University (Second Military Medical University) from Sep. 2016 to Mar. 2017 were surveyed. The Chinese version of EORTC QLQ-C30 and lung cancer specific module QLQ-LC13 were used to assess the quality of life of the inpatients. The multiple linear regression analysis was performed to analyze the factors influencing life quality, with the general data of the inpatients as independent variables and the scores of various domains of life quality as dependent variables. Results A total of 95 valid questionnaires were recovered, and the response rate was 79.2%. Gender, age, occupation, residence, number of children, smoking, drinking, tumor staging, metastasis, with or without concomitant diseases and frequency of chemotherapy were related to the scores of different domains of life quality (P<0.05). Patients with younger age (<50 years old) had higher symptom scores of anorexia (β＝－8.266), diarrhea (β＝－5.263), and dysphagia (β＝－6.307). Female patients had a lower score of cognitive function (β＝－11.270), and had higher symptom scores of nausea/vomiting (β＝11.725) and anorexia (β＝17.090) versus male patients. Patients with advanced tumor stage () or without occupation both had higher symptom scores of diarrhea (β＝2.070, 7.130). Patients with frequent chemotherapies (more than six times) had a higher symptom score of pain (β＝5.871). Patients with concomitant diseases had a lower score of overall health status (β＝－17.239), and had higher symptom scores of peripheral neuropathy (β＝11.970) and pain in the chest (β＝11.061). Smoking patients had a higher symptom score of dyspnea (β＝21.151). Drinking patients had a higher symptom score of constipation (β＝13.525). Patients with tumor metastasis had a higher score of role function (β＝15.039). Residence was associated with several domains of life quality; inpatients in Shanghai had better life quality. Patients with large number of children (≥2) were more emotionally stable (β＝10.078). Conclusion Patients with lung cancer should be concerned about their physical condition and psychological condition during treatment. It is necessary to provide corresponding social support and psychological counseling based on the individual characteristics in order to improve the quality of life and prognosis of lung cancer patients.","['Sun, H.', 'Wang, W.-J.', 'Zhou, Q.', 'Chang, Y.-F.', 'Han, J.-H.', 'Zhu, Z.-P.', 'Lu, X.-F.', 'Su, T.']",10.16781/j.0258-879x.2018.06.0615
Clinical outcomes of black vs. non-black patients with locally advanced non–small cell lung cancer,"Objectives The black population remains underrepresented in clinical trials despite reports suggesting greater incidence and deaths from locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We determined outcomes for black and non-black patients in a well-annotated cohort treated with either definitive chemoradiation (CRT; bimodality) or CRT followed by surgery (trimodality therapy). Materials and Methods A retrospective analysis of 355 stage III NSCLC patients treated with curative intent at the University of Maryland, Medical Center, between January 2000-December 2013 was performed. The Kaplan–Meier approach and the Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze overall survival (OS) and freedom-from-recurrence (FFR) in black and non-black patients. The chi-square test was used to compare categorical variables. Results Black patients comprised 42% of the cohort and were more likely to be younger (p < 0.0001), male (p = 0.030), single (p < 0.0001), reside in lower household income zipcodes (p < 0.0001), have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status >0 (p < 0.001), and less likely to undergo surgery (p < 0.0001). With a median follow-up of 15 months for all patients and 89 months for surviving patients (range:1–186 months), median OS times for black and non-black patients were 22 and 24 months, respectively (p = 0.698). FFR rates were also comparable between the two groups (p = 0.468). Surgery improved OS in both cohorts. Race was not a significant predictor for OS or FFR even when adjusted for other factors. Conclusions We found similar oncologic outcomes in black and non-black NSCLC patients when treated with curative intent in a comprehensive cancer center setting, despite epidemiologic differences in presentation and receipt of care. Future efforts to improve outcomes in black patients could focus on addressing modifiable social disparities.","['Vyfhuis, M.A.', 'Bhooshan, N.', 'Molitoris, J.', 'Bentzen, S.M.', 'Feliciano, J.', 'Edelman, M.', 'Burrows, W.M.', 'Nichols, E.M.', 'Suntharalingam, M.', 'Donahue, J.', 'Nagib, M.', 'Carr, S.R.', 'Friedberg, J.', 'Badiyan, S.', 'Simone, C.B.', 'Feigenberg, S.J.', 'Mohindra, P.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2017.10.016
Impact of sex on prognostic host factors in surgical patients with lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer has markedly poorer survival in men. Recognized important prognostic factors are divided into host, tumour and environmental factors. Traditional staging systems that use only tumour factors to predict prognosis are of limited accuracy. By examining sex-based patterns of disease-specific survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients, we determined the effect of sex on the prognostic value of additional host factors. METHODS: Two cohorts of patients treated surgically with curative intent between 2000 and 2009 were utilized. The primary cohort was from Melbourne, Australia, with an independent validation set from the American Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate analyses of validated host-related prognostic factors were performed in both cohorts to investigate the differences in survival between men and women. RESULTS: The Melbourne cohort had 605 patients (61% men) and SEER cohort comprised 55 681 patients (51% men). Disease-specific 5-year survival showed men had statistically significant poorer survival in both cohorts (P < 0.001); Melbourne men at 53.2% compared with women at 68.3%, and SEER 53.3% men and 62.0% women were alive at 5 years. Being male was independently prognostic for disease-specific mortality in the Melbourne cohort after adjustment for ethnicity, smoking history, performance status, age, pathological stage and histology (hazard ratio = 1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.10-2.16, P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Sex differences in non-small cell lung cancer are important irrespective of age, ethnicity, smoking, performance status and tumour, node and metastasis stage. Epidemiological findings such as these should be translated into research and clinical paradigms to determine the factors that influence the survival disadvantage experienced by men.","['Wainer, Z.', 'Wright, G.M.', 'Gough, K.', 'Daniels, M.G.', 'Choong, P.', 'Conron, M.', 'Russell, P.A.', 'Alam, N.Z.', 'Ball, D.', 'Solomon, B.']",10.1111/ans.13728
Incidence and mortality of lung cancer: global trends and association with socioeconomic status,"We examined the correlation between lung cancer incidence/mortality and country-specific socioeconomic development, and evaluated its most recent global trends. We retrieved its age-standardized incidence rates from the GLOBOCAN database, and temporal patterns were assessed from global databases. We employed simple linear regression analysis to evaluate their correlations with Human Development Index (HDI) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. The average annual percent changes (AAPC) of the trends were evaluated from join-point regression analysis. Country-specific HDI was strongly correlated with age-standardized incidence (r = 0.70) and mortality (r = 0.67), and to a lesser extent GDP (r = 0.24 to 0.55). Among men, 22 and 30 (out of 38 and 36) countries showed declining incidence and mortality trends, respectively; whilst among women, 19 and 16 countries showed increasing incidence and mortality trends, respectively. Among men, the AAPCs ranged from -2.8 to -0.6 (incidence) and -3.6 to -1.1 (mortality) in countries with declining trend, whereas among women the AAPC range was 0.4 to 8.9 (incidence) and 1 to 4.4 (mortality) in countries with increasing trend. Among women, Brazil, Spain and Cyprus had the greatest incidence increase, and all countries in Western, Southern and Eastern Europe reported increasing mortality. These findings highlighted the need for targeted preventive measures.","['Wong, M.C.S.', 'Lao, X.Q.', 'Ho, K.-F.', 'Goggins, W.B.', 'Tse, S.L.A.']",10.1038/s41598-017-14513-7
Sex differences in cancer risk and survival: A Swedish cohort study,"Aim The aim of this study is to firmly delineate temporal and age trends regarding sex discrepancies in cancer risk and survival as well as quantifying the potential gain achieved by eliminating this inequality. Methods We performed a population-based cohort study using data on all adult incident cancer cases (n = 872,397) recorded in the Swedish Cancer Register in 1970–2014. To assess the associations between sex and cancer risk and sex and survival, male-to-female incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and excess mortality ratios (EMRs) adjusted for age and year of diagnosis were estimated using Poisson regression. Results Men were at increased risk for 34 of 39 and had poorer prognosis for 27 of 39 cancers. Women were at increased risk for 5 of 39 and had significantly poorer survival for 2 of 39 cancers. IRRs among male predominant sites ranged from 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.03–-1.1 (lung adenocarcinoma) to 8.0; 95% CI, 7.5–8.5 (larynx). EMRs among sites with male survival disadvantage ranged from 1.1; 95% CI, 1.03–1.1 (colon) to 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5–-2.8 (well-differentiated thyroid). Conclusion Male sex is associated with increased risk and poorer survival for most cancer sites. Identifying and eliminating factors driving the observed sex differences may reduce the global cancer burden.","['Radkiewicz, C.', 'Johansson, A.L.V.', 'Dickman, P.W.', 'Lambe, M.', 'Edgren, G.']",10.1016/j.ejca.2017.07.013
"Disparities in the Management of Patients With Stage I Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (SCLC): A Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Analysis","We identified 1902 patients with stage I SCLC from the SEER database. Of these, 28.5% underwent surgical resection. The proportion of patients undergoing surgical resection from 2007 to 2013 remained unchanged despite better outcomes with surgical resection. We identified significant disparities in the treatment of patients with stage I SCLC; elderly African American men with Medicaid insurance were less likely to receive surgical resection. Introduction Patients with stage I small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) are candidates for surgery; however, not much is known regarding the utilization of surgical resection in the management of stage I SCLC and the factors that determine the patient's ability to receive surgery. Methods The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database was used to identify patients with stage I SCLC from 2007 to 2013. Continuous variables were compared with 1-way analysis of variance, and categorical variables were compared with χ2 testing. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to obtain odds ratios. Results Of the 1902 patients with stage I SCLC, 427 (22.4%) underwent resection, 116 (6.1%) resection and radiation, 815 (42.8%) received radiation alone, and 544 (28.6%) did not undergo surgery or radiation. Median overall survival for patients with surgery plus radiation was 60+ months, followed by surgery alone at 50 months, radiation at 27 months, and no resection/radiation 16 months. Patients with ≥ 4 lymph nodes removed during surgery had better overall survival of 60+ months compared with patients with < 4 lymph nodes removed (25 months); P < .001. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that elderly patients, men, African American individuals, Medicaid recipients, and patients with left-sided tumors were less likely to undergo resection. However, county-level socioeconomic factors, such as level of poverty, education, unemployment, and median income did not affect the likelihood of undergoing resection. Conclusions Fewer than one-third of all patients with stage I SCLC undergo resection despite better outcomes with resection. Elderly African American men with Medicaid insurance were less likely to receive resection.","['Ahmed, Z.', 'Kujtan, L.', 'Kennedy, K.F.', 'Davis, J.R.', 'Subramanian, J.']",10.1016/j.cllc.2017.03.003
Educational inequality in cancer mortality: a record linkage study of over 35 million Italians,"Purpose: Large studies are needed to evaluate socioeconomic inequality for site-specific cancer mortality. We conducted a longitudinal census-based national study to quantify the relative inequality in cancer mortality among educational levels in Italy. Methods: We linked the 2011 Italian census with the 2012 and 2013 death registries. Educational inequality in overall cancer and site-specific cancer mortality were evaluated by computing the mortality rate ratio (MRR). Results: A total of 35,708,445 subjects aged 30–74 years and 147,981 cancer deaths were registered. Compared to the lowest level of education (none or primary school), the MRR for all cancers in the highest level (university) was 0.57 (95% CI 0.55; 0.58) in men and 0.84 (95% CI 0.81; 0.87) in women. Higher education was associated with reduced risk of mortality from lip, oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon and liver in both sexes. Higher education (university) was associated with decreased risk of lung cancer in men (MRR: 0.43, 95% CI 0.41; 0.46), but not in women (MRR: 1.00, 95% CI 0.92; 1.10). Highly educated women had a reduced risk of mortality from cervical cancer than lower educated women (MRR: 0.39, 95% CI 0.27; 0.56), but they had a similar risk for breast cancer (MRR: 1.01, 95% CI 0.94; 1.09). Conclusions: Education is inversely associated with total cancer mortality, and the association was stronger in men. Different patterns and trends in tobacco smoking in men and women account for at least most of the gender differences.","['Alicandro, G.', 'Frova, L.', 'Sebastiani, G.', 'El Sayed, I.', 'Boffetta, P.', 'La Vecchia, C.']",10.1007/s10552-017-0930-y
Social determinants and lung cancer,"The impact of social disparities and the organization of cares on the management of lung cancers is beginning to be studied in France and in other high-income countries. In terms of mortality, there are surprising differences between European countries, England being one of the countries where the results are worst. This is probably why many teams are working on these social determinants. In this article, we first analyze the impact of social precariousness on the incidence and management of lung cancers and analyze the social and occupational consequences of lung cancers. Social precariousness increases the incidence of lung cancer, more significantly in men than in women, probably in relation to an increase in smoking in these populations. Social disadvantage also increases the percentage of patients for whom diagnosis is made after an emergency consultation. And it is clear, that this mode of entry in the disease increases the 30 days and one-year mortality rates. Social disadvantage is also linked to less access to carcinological resection and to innovative treatments. Finally, lung cancers, more important than for other localizations, results in significant social discriminations and a more uncertain return to work. Conclusion: considering these disparities, organizing the care pathways and prepare the post-cancer period are key elements to improve the quality of care for lung cancers patients.","['Chouaïd, C.', 'de Torcy, M.', 'Boudjemaa, A.', 'Ben Hassen, I.', 'Vinas, F.']",10.1016/S1877-1203(17)30065-4
Radiation Treatment Time and Overall Survival in Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"Purpose Prolonged radiation treatment (RT) time (RTT) has been associated with worse survival in several malignancies. The present study investigated whether delays during RT are associated with overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods and Materials The National Cancer Database was queried for patients with stage III NSCLC who had received definitive concurrent chemotherapy and fractionated RT to standard doses (59.4-70.0 Gy) and fractionation from 2004 to 2013. The RTT was classified as standard or prolonged for each treatment regimen according to the radiation dose and number of fractions. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between the following factors and OS: RTT, RT fractionation, demographic and pathologic factors, and chemotherapeutic agents. Results Of 14,154 patients, the RTT was prolonged in 6262 (44.2%). Factors associated with prolonged RTT included female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.21, P<.0001), black race (OR 1.20, P=.001), nonprivate health insurance (OR 1.30, P<.0001), and lower income (<$63,000 annually, OR 1.20, P<.0001). The median OS was significantly worse for patients with prolonged RTT than that for those with standard RTT (18.6 vs 22.7 months, P<.0001). Furthermore, the OS worsened with each cumulative interval of delay (standard RTT vs prolonged 1-2 days, 20.5 months, P=.009; prolonged 3-5 days, 17.9 months, P<.0001; prolonged 6-9 days, 17.7 months, P<.0001; prolonged >9 days, 17.1 months, P<.0001). On multivariable analysis, prolonged RTT was independently associated with inferior OS (hazard ratio 1.21, P<.0001). Prolonged RTT as a continuous variable was also significantly associated with worse OS (hazard ratio 1.001, P=.0007). Conclusions Delays during RT appear to negatively affect survival for patients with locally advanced NSCLC. We have detailed the demographic and socioeconomic barriers influencing prolonged RTT as a method to address the health disparities in this regard. Cumulative interruptions of RT should be minimized.","['McMillan, M.T.', 'Ojerholm, E.', 'Verma, V.', 'Higgins, K.A.', 'Singhal, S.', 'Predina, J.D.', 'Berman, A.T.', 'Grover, S.', 'Robinson, C.G.', 'Simone, C.B.']",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.04.004
Association between smoking and health outcomes in an economically deprived population: the Liverpool Lung Project,"BACKGROUND: The association between smoking and several health outcomes among those from the most deprived communities in the UK has not previously been detailed. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of smoking on health outcomes specifically among a particularly deprived population in a developed country (Liverpool; one of the most deprived local authorities in England). METHODS: The Liverpool Lung Project recruited a prospective cohort of 8753 participants from across Liverpool, aged 45-79 years between 1998 and 2008. Participants were followed annually through the Hospital Episode Statistics until 31 January 2013. Logistic regression models were used to identify health outcomes of smoking. RESULTS: From our study population, 5195 were smokers and 3558 were non-smokers. Smoking was associated with male gender (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.48 to 1.77), pneumonia (1.28, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.49), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48), emphysema (5.46, 95% CI 3.48 to 8.55), bronchitis (1.85, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.07), other cancers (1.69, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.99), lung cancer (6.0, 95% CI 3.72 to 9.69), diabetes (1.21, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.43) and cardiovascular disease (1.45, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.67). CONCLUSIONS: Smokers from deprived backgrounds in Liverpool showed increased risk of developing pneumonia, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, lung cancer, other types of cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. These findings are in line with the literature and may help to inform public health policies and ultimately work towards addressing smoking-related health inequalities.","['Sherratt, F.C.', 'Field, J.K.', 'Marcus, M.W.']",10.1136/jech-2016-208730
"Stigmatization in Employed Patients with Breast, Intestinal, Prostate and Lung Cancer","Background The stigma of cancer patients can lead to far-reaching consequences, both for the individual and for the society. Quantitative studies on the stigmatization of cancer patients are scarce. The present study assessed the stigma of cancer patients in relation to their status of employment, and analyzes sociodemographic, disease and occupational predictors. Methods In a bicentric study, 858 patients with breast, bowel, lung or prostate cancer were included. Of these, n=305 were employed and entered into the analyses (age average 55 years, 43% female, 47% breast cancer). As a comparison group, a matched sample of non-employed persons (n=213) is used from our data set. In addition to questions on work and health aspects, stigmatization was measured using the SIS-D (Social Impact Scale). The data are evaluated uni- and multivariable. Results Employed persons with prostate or breast cancer are less stigmatized (p<0.01) than non-employed persons, with effects between d=0.35-0.97. The strongest influence on perceived stigma is the lack of support from the employer, further predictors are poor health, low mental workability and diagnosis of breast cancer (R2 of the final model=0.35). Conclusion The employment of cancer patients is associated with lesser perceived stigmatization. Occupational stigmatization depends above all on the work environment or the employer's supportive attitude.","['Ernst, J.', 'Mehnert, A.', 'Taubenheim, S.', 'Rentsch, A.', 'Hornemann, B.', 'Esser, P.']",10.1055/s-0043-110138
"A comparative, retrospective observational study between experimental LUNG 7 studies and real practice of Afatinib and Gefitinib on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with positive EGFR mutation treatment naive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) treatment","Introduction. Afatinib and Gefitinib, pharmaceuticals used for treatment of non-squamous EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer, stage IIIB-IV, have been compared in the randomized controlled experimental study phase IIB LUNG 7, a multicenter, international study carried out in 64 centers of 13 different countries. Only patients who had never undergone oncological treatment have been recruited. The study was carried out in double blind and the selected end-points were the Progression Free Survival (PFS) and the Overall Survival (OS). The goal of our analysis was the comparison between the data obtained from the experimental study LUNG 7 and the ""real practice"" data from the Monitoring Database AIFA (Registro di Monitoraggio) collected from five Italian hospitals. Materials and Methods. The experimental data, obtained from the eligibility criteria mentioned in the AIFA database, have been compared using parameters such as: Age, gender, ethnic group, smoker/no smoker and molecular characterization of the lung tumor, with possible presence of metastasis. Results. The number of patients treated with Afatinib is 160 in the LUNG 7 study and 6 in the AIFA database. The PFS for Afatinib obtained in our analysis is smaller than the one from LUNG 7. The number of patients treated with Gefitinib is 159 in the LUNG 7 study and 33 in the AIFA database. In this case, the PFS calculated in the present study matches the results from LUNG 7. Conclusions. The number of cases is too small to obtain significant results, especially for Afatinib. In some cases, the data entered in the AIFA database by oncologists and pharmacists are not managed in real time, thus determining a bias in the analysis. By expanding the initiative to other hospitals and managing the AIFA database more efficiently, it will be possible to obtain more significant and reliable data. The present study has allowed a critical evaluation of an experimental study, taking advantage of the data from the AIFA database for post marketing analysis and to optimize prescriptions for a better distribution of the available resources. We established also a reproducible method for the evaluation of the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals in clinical practice. Finally, this study promoted the collaboration among peers from different hospitals to encourage collegiality.","['Lacerenza, L.G.', 'Allegri, P.', 'Lerda, C.', 'Logreco, A.', 'Martellucci, M.G.', 'Boni, M.', 'Costantini, A.']",10.1721/2784.28068
Differences in distress severity among oncology patients treated by a consultation–liaison service. A five-year survey in Germany,"Background and objectives Cancer diagnosis commonly causes distress. There are associations between distress levels and clinical and psychosocial variables, but they are not necessarily dependent on cancer type. We assessed whether distress in hospitalised oncology patients treated by a consultation–liaison service (CLS) varied with oncological diagnosis or sociodemographic, clinical and care variables. Methods A naturalistic, retrospective survey of all cancer patients (N = 2864) treated by a CLS over a five-year period (2012–2016). Data were collected using standardised documents. Differences were analysed using bivariate regression. Multivariate linear regression and logistic regression respectively were used to assess associations between distress as a continuous (0–10) or dichotomous variable (0–4 vs. 5–10) and clinical and care variables. Results Bivariate tests showed that the following characteristics were associated with higher distress levels: female (68.5%); foreign (7.9%); psychiatric comorbidity (18.9%); electively referral (23.6%); two or more interventions (20.7%); psychotherapeutic (35.3%) or psychopharmacological (5.4%) interventions; post-discharge treatment recommendation (23.3%). Level of functioning (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Scale-ECOG), number of contacts and cumulative treatment time were positively associated with distress, unlike age. Patients with gynaecological, lung, otorhinolaryngological and brain cancers had higher distress levels. Multivariate linear regression largely confirmed the bivariate results. Logistic regression demonstrated that a dichotomous distress variable did not differentiate between cancer types. Conclusions Distress is less strongly related to cancer type than other clinical factors, e.g. psychiatric comorbidity, autonomy. Highly distressed patients should receive more intensive CLS care, irrespective of specific diagnosis. The positive association between elective referral and distress indicates that the CLS referral process works well.","['Valdés-Stauber, J.', 'Bachthaler, S.']",10.1016/j.ejpsy.2017.06.002
"Lung cancer incidence trends in California by race/ethnicity, histology, sex, and neighborhood socioeconomic status: An analysis spanning 28 years","Objectives Lung cancer incidence trends by histology, sex, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) have not been previously reported. We conducted a population-based study of lung cancer incidence over three peri-censal periods: 1988–1992, 1998–2002, and 2008–2012. Materials and methods We abstracted lung cancer cases from the California Cancer Registry and used US Census and American Community Survey data to develop multidimensional nSES indices for each census period. We calculated nSES tertile-specific incidence rates and rate ratios for each peri-censal period and used incidence rate ratios (IRR) to assess changes in rates from 1988 to 1992 to 1998–2002 and 2008–2012. Results There were a total of 231,205 lung cancer cases. Males: Among males, incidence rates of lung cancer decreased over time, all race/ethnicities, and all nSES tertiles, with larger declines among males in higher nSES areas. Rates either declined or were stable for adenocarcinoma, with larger declines for other histologic subtypes. Females: Among females, declines in incidence rates of lung cancer were more pronounced for females in higher nSES areas, but diverged more so than for males, with variations by histology and race/ethnicity. Incidence rates of adenocarcinoma increased over time among all females, with greater increase among females in low nSES areas. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate differences in incidence trends over three decades by histology, gender, race/ethnicity, and nSES. While incidence rates consistently declined over time for males, there were greater declines in incidence for high nSES populations. In contrast, among females, there was evidence of increases in lung cancer incidence among low SES API females, and for adenocarcinoma.","['Patel, M.I.', 'McKinley, M.', 'Cheng, I.', 'Haile, R.', 'Wakelee, H.', 'Gomez, S.L.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2017.03.014
"Global, Regional, and National Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and Disability-Adjusted Life-years for 32 Cancer Groups, 1990 to 2015: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study","Importance: Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning. Objective: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. Evidence Review: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results. Findings: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. Conclusion and Relevance: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.","['Fitzmaurice, C.', 'Allen, C.', 'Barber, R.M.', 'Barregard, L.', 'Bhutta, Z.A.', 'Brenner, H.', 'Dicker, D.J.', 'Chimed-Orchir, O.', 'Dandona, R.', 'Dandona, L.', 'Fleming, T.', 'Forouzanfar, M.H.', 'Hancock, J.', 'Hay, R.J.', 'Hunter-Merrill, R.', 'Huynh, C.', 'Hosgood, H.D.', 'Johnson, C.O.', 'Jonas, J.B.', 'Khubchandani, J.', 'Kumar, G.A.', 'Kutz, M.', 'Lan, Q.', 'Larson, H.J.', 'Liang, X.', 'Lim, S.S.', 'Lopez, A.D.', 'MacIntyre, M.F.', 'Marczak, L.', 'Marquez, N.', 'Mokdad, A.H.', 'Pinho, C.', 'Pourmalek, F.', 'Salomon, J.A.', 'Sanabria, J.R.', 'Sandar, L.', 'Sartorius, B.', 'Schwartz, S.M.', 'Shackelford, K.A.', 'Shibuya, K.', 'Stanaway, J.', 'Steiner, C.', 'Sun, J.', 'Takahashi, K.', 'Vollset, S.E.', 'Vos, T.', 'Wagner, J.A.', 'Wang, H.', 'Westerman, R.', 'Zeeb, H.', 'Zoeckler, L.', 'Abd-Allah, F.', 'Ahmed, M.B.', 'Alabed, S.', 'Alam, N.K.', 'Aldhahri, S.F.', 'Alem, G.', 'Alemayohu, M.A.', 'Ali, R.', 'Al-Raddadi, R.', 'Amare, A.', 'Amoako, Y.', 'Artaman, A.', 'Asayesh, H.', 'Atnafu, N.', 'Awasthi, A.', 'Saleem, H.B.', 'Barac, A.', 'Bedi, N.', 'Bensenor, I.', 'Berhane, A.', 'Bernabé, E.', 'Betsu, B.', 'Binagwaho, A.', 'Boneya, D.', 'Campos-Nonato, I.', 'Castañeda-Orjuela, C.', 'Catalá-López, F.', 'Chiang, P.', 'Chibueze, C.', 'Chitheer, A.', 'Choi, J.-Y.', 'Cowie, B.', 'Damtew, S.', 'das Neves, J.', 'Dey, S.', 'Dharmaratne, S.', 'Dhillon, P.', 'Ding, E.', 'Driscoll, T.', 'Ekwueme, D.', 'Endries, A.Y.', 'Farvid, M.', 'Farzadfar, F.', 'Fernandes, J.', 'Fischer, F.', 'G/Hiwot, T.T.', 'Gebru, A.', 'Gopalani, S.', 'Hailu, A.', 'Horino, M.', 'Horita, N.', 'Husseini, A.', 'Huybrechts, I.', 'Inoue, M.', 'Islami, F.', 'Jakovljevic, M.', 'James, S.', 'Javanbakht, M.', 'Jee, S.H.', 'Kasaeian, A.', 'Kedir, M.S.', 'Khader, Y.S.', 'Khang, Y.-H.', 'Kim, D.', 'Leigh, J.', 'Linn, S.', 'Lunevicius, R.', 'El Razek, H.M.A.', 'Malekzadeh, R.', 'Malta, D.C.', 'Marcenes, W.', 'Markos, D.', 'Melaku, Y.A.', 'Meles, K.G.', 'Mendoza, W.', 'Mengiste, D.T.', 'Meretoja, T.J.', 'Miller, T.R.', 'Mohammad, K.A.', 'Mohammadi, A.', 'Mohammed, S.', 'Moradi-Lakeh, M.', 'Nagel, G.', 'Nand, D.', 'Le Nguyen, Q.', 'Nolte, S.', 'Ogbo, F.A.', 'Oladimeji, K.E.', 'Oren, E.', 'Pa, M.', 'Park, E.-K.', 'Pereira, D.M.', 'Plass, D.', 'Qorbani, M.', 'Radfar, A.', 'Rafay, A.', 'Rahman, M.', 'Rana, S.M.', 'Søreide, K.', 'Satpathy, M.', 'Sawhney, M.', 'Sepanlou, S.G.', 'Shaikh, M.A.', 'She, J.', 'Shiue, I.', 'Shore, H.R.', 'Shrime, M.G.', 'So, S.', 'Soneji, S.', 'Stathopoulou, V.', 'Stroumpoulis, K.', 'Sufiyan, M.B.', 'Sykes, B.L.', 'Tabarés-Seisdedos, R.', 'Tadese, F.', 'Tedla, B.A.', 'Tessema, G.A.', 'Thakur, J.S.', 'Tran, B.X.', 'Ukwaja, K.N.', 'Uzochukwu, B.S.C.', 'Vlassov, V.V.', 'Weiderpass, E.', 'Wubshet Terefe, M.', 'Yebyo, H.G.', 'Yimam, H.H.', 'Yonemoto, N.', 'Younis, M.Z.', 'Yu, C.', 'Zaidi, Z.', 'Zaki, M.E.S.', 'Zenebe, Z.M.', 'Murray, C.J.L.']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.5688
"Patients receiving care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer in small, independent oncology practices are more likely to receive chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life","Objectives: To determine whether a treating oncologist's characteristics are associated with variation in use of chemotherapy for patients with advanced non.small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) at the end of life. Study Design: Retrospective cohort. Methods: Using the 2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results.Medicare database, we studied chemotherapy receipt within 30 days of death among Medicare enrollees who were diagnosed with aNSCLC between 1999 and 2006, received chemotherapy, and died within 3 years of diagnosis. A multilevel model was constructed to assess the contribution of patient and physician characteristics and geography to receiving chemotherapy within 30 days of death. Results: Among 21,894 patients meeting eligibility criteria, 43.1% received chemotherapy within 30 days of death. In unadjusted bivariate analyses, female sex, Asian or black race, older age, and a greater number of comorbid diagnoses predicted lower likelihood of receiving chemotherapy at the end of life (P ≤038 for all comparisons). Adjusting for patient and physician characteristics, physicians in small independent practices were substantially more likely than those employed in other practice models, particularly academic practices or nongovernment hospitals, to order chemotherapy for a patient in the last 30 days of life (P <.001 for all comparisons); female physicians were less likely than males to prescribe such treatment (P =.04). Conclusions: Patients receiving care for aNSCLC in small independent oncology practices are more likely to receive chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life.","['Green, J.B.', 'Shapiro, M.F.', 'Ettner, S.L.', 'Malin, J.', 'Ang, A.', 'Wong, M.D.']",
Interaction of treatment and biomarker in advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"Purpose: There has been a long-standing interest in the investigation of interactions in science. The objective of the study is to evaluate interaction between Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation and treatment from randomized, phase II study of chemotherapy versus chemotherapy plus erlotinib in patients with progressive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) following clinical benefit from erlotinib. Materials and Methods: Forty-six patients with advanced stage NSCLC and progression from erlotinib were randomized to receive chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) or chemotherapy plus erlotinib between 2008 and 2012. Patient characteristics at baseline including age, gender, tumor stage, race, smoking history and EGFR mutation status along with the clinical outcomes, namely response, Progression- Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) were obtained. The effects of treatment, EGFR mutation and interaction between the two on survival outcomes were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards model with first-order interaction. Results: For PFS, there was a significant interaction between treatment (arm B) and EGFR mutation (mutant EGFR+) (p = 0.018), although the main effects of treatment (arm B vs. arm A) and EGFR mutation (mutant vs. wild-type EGFR) were statistically significant (with p = 0.03 and p = 0.088, respectively) favoring arm B and mutant EGFR+. Thus when taking the interaction between treatment and EGFR into account, the hazard ratio comparing arm B to arm A when EGFR is positive was 1.49 (95% CI: 0.72, 3.11); and the hazard ratio comparing arm B to arm A when EGFR is negative was 0.17 (95% CI: 0.04 - 0.84). Similarly, for OS, there was a significant interaction between treatment and EGFR mutation (p = 0.02), with significant main effects of treatment and EGFR favoring arm B and mutant EFGR+. Taking together, the hazard ratio comparing arm B to arm A when EGFR is positive was 1.61 (95% CI: 0.68 - 3.82); and the hazard ratio comparing arm B to arm A when EGFR is negative was 0.16 (95% CI: 0.03 - 0.9). Conclusion: The interaction identified by Cox model shows there was an antagonistic effect between chemotherapy + erlotinib and EGFR mutation, a situation that the whole is less than the sum of the parts, despite the prolonging-survival main effect of each factor from Cox model. As a result, the continuing erlotinib beyond progression adds no benefit in survival outcomes but leads to an increase in adverse events.","['Fu, P.', 'Pennell, N.A.', 'Sharma, N.', 'Yi, Q.', 'Dowlati, A.', 'Halmos, B.']",10.2174/1574887111666160916130423
Addition of Surgery After Radiation Significantly Improves Survival in Stage IIIB Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Limited work, either retrospective or prospective, has been done to investigate whether or not there is a cause-specific mortality (CSM) or all-cause mortality (ACM) benefit to adding surgery following neoadjuvant treatment for Stage IIIB NSCLC. METHODS: We extracted patients with Stage IIIB NSCLC from the Survival, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database treated from 2004 to 2012 with either radiation alone or radiation followed by surgery. Other variables extracted were age, sex, race, and tumor location. The impact of patient and treatment variables on CSM and ACM was explored using Cox multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 14,065 patients were extracted from the SEER database. On multivariable analysis, even after adjustment for age, gender, race, and site, radiation followed by surgery was associated with a reduction in cause-specific mortality compared to radiation alone (adjusted HR 0.46; 95 % CI 0.41, 0.52; p < 0.0001). Median overall survival was 11 months in the radiotherapy alone arm versus 29 months in the radiotherapy plus surgery arm (p < 0.0001 by log-rank test). After adjustment for these same factors, radiation followed by surgery was also associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality compared with radiation alone (adjusted HR 0.47; 95 % CI 0.42, 0.52; p < 0.0001). Median cause-specific survival was 12 months in the radiotherapy alone arm versus 33 months in the radiotherapy plus surgery arm (p < 0.0001 by log-rank test). DISCUSSION: In the SEER database, there appears to be both a CSM and ACM benefit to adding surgery following radiation for Stage IIIB NSCLC.","['Herskovic, A.', 'Chitti, B.', 'Christos, P.', 'Wernicke, A.G.', 'Parashar, B.']",10.1007/s00268-016-3764-y
"Differences in age-distribution, oncological diagnoses and stage in roma and non-roma cancer patients registered at the outpatient oncology department poprad in 2014 and 2015 - A retrospective study","Background: Roma (Gypsies) constitute the largest ethnic minority in Slovakia. Although some studies have reported a higher prevalence of communicable diseases in Roma, there have been no studies on cancer prevalence in Roma. The aim of this study was to compare differences in age at diagnosis, oncological diagnoses, and stage between Roma and non-Roma patients registered at a single oncology outpatient department in Eastern Slovakia where substantial numbers of Roma patients are treated. Patients and Methods: Roma and non-Roma cancer patients were identified based on the judgement of both the treating physician and nurse. Age at diagnosis, oncology diagnoses, and disease stage were compared between Roma and non-Roma patients. Results: Thirty Roma and 702 non-Roma cancer patients were identified. The age distribution at diagnosis was not statistically different between Roma and non-Roma for both male and female patients. A statistically significant difference was detected in the number of Roma men having lung cancer (risk ratio - RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.13-0.35; p < 0.01), and more Roma women had kidney cancer (RR 0.16; 95% CI 0.05-0.69; p = 0.01). There were numerically more Roma patients diagnosed with TNM stage IV disease. Significantly more Roma men were diagnosed with stage IV disease than with stage I-III disease. Condusion: The data suggest that differences in cancer type exist between Roma and non-Roma patients. Larger population-based studies directed at analyzing for differences between Roma and non-Roma cancer patients are warranted.","['Reckova, M.', 'Mardiak, J.', 'Beniak, J.', 'Kakalejcik, M.', 'Medvecova, L.', 'Cingelova, S.', 'Mego, M.']",10.14735/amko201741
The assessment of cancer-related fatigue syndrome in patients with lung cancer during palliative chemotherapy,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer-related fatigue is one of the most common problems of patients with lung cancer. The assessment of cancer- -related fatigue is therefore a significant medical problem in patients during treatment with palliative chemotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 100 patients during palliative chemotherapy because of lung cancer. The study was conducted in the Department of Pulmonary Diseases and Treatment of Lung Cancer in the Kuyavian and Pomeranian Centre of Pulmonology in Bydgoszcz, in the period from February to June 2016. The study used a socio-demographic questionnaire and Cancer Related Fatigue scale (CRF) consisting of 22 closed questions. RESULTS: Men accounted for 68% of the study group, people with vocational education - 61%, and people living in the city - 61%. People aged 51-65 formed the largest group. The mean value for behavioural fatigue was 5.34 points, the sensory one - 5.44 points, cognitive/mood fatigue - 4.29 points (moderate levels), whereas mean value for affective fatigue was at a serious level - 5.89 points. The average severity of general fatigue was 5.2 points (moderate level of fatigue). CONCLUSIONS: The moderate level of cancer-related fatigue occurs in half of patients treated with chemotherapy because of lung cancer, and lasts for several months. Behavioural, sensory, cognitive/mood and general fatigue have moderate levels but affective fatigue has a severe level. Radiation therapy affects the severity of cognitive/mood fatigue, lowers economic status, influences behavioural fatigue and education level, and has an effect on general fatigue. In multivariate analysis, only the reduction of economic status has a significant impact on the severity of fatigue.  .","['Nowicki, A.', 'Piekarska, J.', 'Farbicka, E.']",10.5603/ARM.2017.0013
"Differences in mortality between groups of older migrants and older non-migrants in Belgium, 2001-09","BACKGROUND: European societies are rapidly ageing and becoming multicultural. We studied differences in overall and cause-specific mortality between migrants and non-migrants in Belgium specifically focusing on the older population. METHODS: We performed a mortality follow-up until 2009 of the population aged 50 and over living in Flanders and the Brussels-Capital Region by linking the 2001 census data with the population and mortality registers. Overall mortality differences were analysed via directly age-standardized mortality rates. Cause-specific mortality differences between non-migrants and various western and non-western migrant groups were analysed using Poisson regression models, controlling for age (model 1) and additionally controlling for socio-economic status and urban typology (model 2). RESULTS: At older ages, most migrants had an overall mortality advantage relative to non-migrants, regardless of a lower socio-economic status. Specific migrant groups (e.g. Turkish migrants, French and eastern European male migrants and German female migrants) had an overall mortality disadvantage, which was, at least partially, attributable to a lower socio-economic status. Despite the general overall mortality advantage, migrants experienced higher mortality from infectious diseases, diabetes-related causes, respiratory diseases (western migrants), cardiovascular diseases (non-western female migrants) and lung cancer (western female migrants). CONCLUSION: Mortality differences between older migrants and non-migrants depend on cause of death, age, sex, migrant origin and socio-economic status. These differences can be related to lifestyle, social networks and health care use. Policies aimed at reducing mortality inequalities between older migrants and non-migrants should address the specific health needs of the various migrant groups, as well as socio-economic disparities.","['Reus-Pons, M.', 'Vandenheede, H.', 'Janssen, F.', 'Kibele, E.U.']",10.1093/eurpub/ckw076
"Lung cancer among native and foreign-born Swedes: histopathology, treatment, and survival","Background: Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, including Sweden. Several studies have shown that socioeconomic status affects the risk, treatment, and survival of LC. Due to immigration after Second World War, foreign-born people constitute 12.5% of the Swedish population. We wanted to investigate if there were any differences in LC management, treatment and survival among the foreign-born Swedes (FBS) compared to the native Swedish population (NatS) in Stockholm. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at the Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergy, Karolinska University Hospital, Solna from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2008 was made. In all, 2041 cases of LC were diagnosed, thereof 1803 with NSCLC. Of these, 211 (11.7%) were FBS. Results: The mean age of NatS and FBS patients was 69.9 years, median 70 (range 26–96) and 66.0 years, median 66 (range 38–94), respectively (p < 0.001). In all, 89.8% of NatS and 90.0% of FBS were either smokers or former smokers. Adenocarcinoma was the most common subtype in both groups (NatS 54.7%, FBS 48.3%). In 140 (8.8%) of the NatS and 17 (8.1%) of the FBS the diagnosis was clinical only. There were no significant differences in stage at diagnosis, nor in performance status (PS) or different therapies between the groups. The median overall survival time for the NatS was 272 days and for FBS 328 days, again no significant difference. However, the median overall survival time for female NatS was 318 days and for female FBS 681 days (p = 0.002). Conclusion: FBS patients were significantly younger than NatS at diagnosis, and female FBS lived longer than female NatS, but otherwise there were no significant differences between NatS and FBS patients with LC regarding diagnosis, treatment, and survival.","['Koyi, H.', 'Hillerdal, G.', 'Andersson, O.', 'Högberg, H.', 'Brandén, E.']",10.1080/0284186X.2016.1189095
Lung cancer mortality trends in China from 1988 to 2013: New challenges and opportunities for the government,"Background: As lung cancer has shown a continuously increasing trend in many countries, it is essential to stay abreast of lung cancer mortality information and take informed actions with a theoretical basis derived from appropriate and practical statistical methods. Methods: Age-specific rates were collected by gender and region (urban/rural) and analysed with descriptive methods and age-period-cohort models to estimate the trends in lung cancer mortality in China from 1988 to 2013. Results: Descriptive analysis revealed that the age-specific mortality rates of lung cancer in rural residents increased markedly over the last three decades, and there was no obvious increase in urban residents. APC analysis showed that the lung cancer mortality rates significantly increased with age (20-84), rose slightly with the time period, and decreased with the cohort, except for the rural cohorts born during the early years (1909-1928). The trends in the patterns of the period and cohort effects showed marked disparities between the urban and rural residents. Conclusions: Lung cancer mortality remains serious and is likely to continue to rise in China. Some known measures are suggested to be decisive factors in mitigating lung cancer, such as environmental conservation, medical security, and tobacco control, which should be implemented more vigorously over the long term in China, especially in rural areas.","['Wang, L.', 'Yu, C.', 'Liu, Y.', 'Wang, J.', 'Li, C.', 'Wang, Q.', 'Wang, P.', 'Wu, S.', 'Zhang, Z.-J.']",10.3390/ijerph13111052
"Black heterogeneity in cancer mortality: US-blacks, Haitians, and Jamaicans","Introduction: The quantitative intraracial burden of cancer incidence, survival and mortality within black populations in the United States is virtually unknown. Methods: We computed cancer mortality rates of US- and Caribbean-born residents of Florida, specifically focusing on black populations (United States, Haiti, Jamaica) and compared them using age-adjusted mortality ratios obtained from Poisson regression models. We compared the mortality of Haitians and Jamaicans residing in Florida to populations in their countries of origin using Globocan. Results: We analyzed 185,113 cancer deaths from 2008 to 2012, of which 20,312 occurred in black populations. The overall risk of death from cancer was 2.1 (95% CI: 1.97-2.17) and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.55-1.71) times higher for US-born blacks than black Caribbean men and women, respectively (P < .001). Conclusions: Race alone is not a determinant of cancer mortality. Among all analyzed races and ethnicities, including Whites and Hispanics, US-born blacks had the highest mortality rates while black Caribbeans had the lowest. The biggest intraracial difference was observed for lung cancer, for which US-blacks had nearly 4 times greater mortality risk than black Caribbeans. Migration from the islands of Haiti and Jamaica to Florida resulted in lower cancer mortality for most cancers including cervical, stomach, and prostate, but increased or stable mortality for 2 obesity-related cancers, colorectal and endometrial cancers. Mortality results in Florida suggest that US-born blacks have the highest incidence rate of ""aggressive"" prostate cancer in the world, rather than Caribbean men.","['Pinheiro, P.S.', 'Callahan, K.E.', 'Ragin, C.', 'Hage, R.W.', 'Hylton, T.', 'Kobetz, E.N.']",10.1177/107327481602300406
Proportion of Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients that Would Have Been Eligible for Lung Cancer Screening,"Lung cancer screening is recommended, but there is limited evidence on the efficacy of existing criteria. We retrospectively applied screening criteria to an institutional cohort of 2030 lung cancer patients to evaluate the utility of current guidelines. Our findings suggest that a significant proportion of former smokers are excluded from screening and that prospective evaluation of existing criteria is warranted. Background Lung cancer screening is recommended for current smokers (CS) and former smokers (FS) who meet specific age and smoking criteria. We used existing criteria to estimate the proportion of non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that would have been screening-eligible. Methods We identified 2030 NSCLC patients at our institution from 1994 to 2014 and recorded their cigarette smoking status and history. Using criteria from the United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) and from other organizations, we ascertained the proportions of screening-eligible patients. Associations among smoking status, gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance type were assessed using Chi-Square test. Results In our cohort, 31.0% (n = 630) were CS, 43.0% (n = 873) were FS, and 26.0% (n = 527) were never smokers. There were 698 patients (34.4%) who met all USPSTF screening criteria. Among 1503 CS and FS, 77.5% (n = 1165) were between age 55 and 80 years, and 67.9% (n = 1021) had smoked ≥ 30 pack-years. Among FS, 50.4% (n = 440) had quit within 15 years of diagnosis. Median pack-years smoked was 40 (interquartile range, 20-55 pack-years). CS were more likely to meet screening criteria than FS (67.5% vs. 31.3%; P < .0001). Significant differences were found among individuals meeting criteria by gender, race/ethnicity, and insurance type. Conclusion Only a third of patients diagnosed with NSCLC were eligible for lung cancer screening based on USPSTF criteria. FS were less likely to meet all screening criteria due to only half meeting the quit-time criterion. Additional evidence is needed to evaluate the utility of restricting screening among FS to those who quit within 15 years.","['Wu, G.X.', 'Goldstein, L.', 'Kim, J.Y.', 'Raz, D.J.']",10.1016/j.cllc.2016.01.001
Lung cancer incidence in never smokers: Genetic and gender basis,"Lung cancer is a leading clinical condition for the high rates of mortality throughout the world. For a long time, it was considered that the risk of lung cancer is associated with smoking. With the advent of new technologies that allowed better diagnostic approaches, knowledge on the genetic basis of lung cancer in never smokers is expanding. In an epidemiological and biological stand point, lung cancer in never smokers is now recognized as a distinct disease entity. In this review, we provide a comprehensive view of the factors that contribute to lung cancer in never smokers. Epidemiological and non-genetic factors such as pollution, occupational exposure, socioeconomic status, infections and medical history determine the risk of lung cancer in never smokers. With regard to genetic factors, chromosomal aberrations, gene polymorphisms, mutations and epigenetic changes in a variety of genes involved in drug metabolism, inflammation, DNA repair and cell proliferation exert a significant effect on the risk of lung cancer in never smokers. Interestingly, it is now believed that the risk of lung cancer is higher in women and the role of female hormones in lung cancer is gaining momentum. The fact that lung cancer is a disease of the smokers is slowly waning and a rethink on the risk factors that cause this disease is very much important. Recent advances using epigenetic screening suggests that lung cancer in never smokers is a distinct disease entity. Epidemiological and clinical studies that screen for lung cancer should opt for a biological rather than a clinical selection. Diagnostic and treatment strategies should be carefully planned for lung cancer patients without a history of smoking because of the differences in the genetics, epigenetics, pathobiology and treatment outcomes in these set of patients.","['Peddireddy, V.']",10.1016/j.genrep.2016.06.003
Racial and gender disparities in incidence of lung and bronchus cancer in the United States: A longitudinal analysis,"Background: Certain population groups in the United States carry a disproportionate burden of cancer. This work models and analyzes the dynamics of lung and bronchus cancer age-adjusted incidence rates by race (White and Black), gender (male and female), and prevalence of daily smoking in 38 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and across eight U.S. geographic regions from 1999 to 2012. Methods: Data, obtained from the U.S. Cancer Statistics Section of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reflect approximately 77% of the U.S. population and constitute a representative sample for making inferences about incidence rates in lung and bronchus cancer (henceforth lung cancer). A longitudinal linear mixed-effects model was used to study lung cancer incidence rates and to estimate incidence rate as a function of time, race, gender, and prevalence of daily smoking. Results: Between 1999 and 2012, age-adjusted incidence rates in lung cancer have decreased in all states and regions. However, racial and gender disparities remain. Whites continue to have lower age-adjusted incidence rates for this cancer than Blacks in all states and in five of the eight U.S. geographic regions. Disparities in incidence rates between Black and White men are significantly larger than those between Black and White women, with Black men having the highest incidence rate of all subgroups. Assuming that lung cancer incidence rates remain within reasonable range, the model predicts that the gender gap in the incidence rate for Whites would disappear by mid-2018, and for Blacks by 2026. However, the racial gap in lung cancer incidence rates among Black and White males will remain. Among all geographic regions, the Mid-South has the highest overall lung cancer incidence rate and the highest incidence rate for Whites, while the Midwest has the highest incidence rate for Blacks. Between 1999 and 2012, there was a downward trend in the prevalence of daily smokers in both genders. However, males have significantly higher rates of cigarette smoking than females at all time points. The highest and lowest prevalence of daily smoking are found in the Mid-South and New England, respectively. There was a significant correlation between lung cancer incidence rates and smoking prevalence in all geographic regions, indicating a strong influence of cigarette smoking on regional lung cancer incidence rates. Conclusion: Although age-adjusted incidence rates in lung cancer have decreased throughout the U.S., racial and gender disparities remain. This longitudinal model can help health professionals and policy makers make predictions of age-adjusted incidence rates for lung cancer in the U.S. in the next five to ten years.","['Tabatabai, M.A.', 'Kengwoung-Keumo, J.-J.', 'Oates, G.R.', 'Guemmegne, J.T.', 'Akinlawon, A.', 'Ekadi, G.', 'Fouad, M.N.', 'Singh, K.P.']",10.1371/journal.pone.0162949
"Trends in the Incidence of Lung Cancer Hospitalizations in Spain, 2001-2011","Objective To analyze changes in the incidence, diagnostic procedures, comorbidity, length of hospital stay and costs of patients hospitalized for lung cancer in Spain between 2001 and 2011. Patients and methods Retrospective study including all patients hospitalised with a primary diagnosis of lung cancer between 2001 and 2011. Data were collected from the National Hospital Discharge Database, encompassing the entire Spanish population. Economic and sociodemographic characteristics and health-related variables were analyzed. Results A total of 298,435 hospitalizations occurred. The overall crude incidence increased from 61.18 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2001 to 65.08 per 100,000 in 2011 (P < .05), with a decrease in men and a proportionate increase in women. The age group with the highest incidence was 70 to 79 years. In 2001, 4.5% of patients had a Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) > 2, and in 2011, prevalence of CCI > 2 increased to 9.1% (P < .05). Mean length of hospital stay decreased during the study period. Computed tomography was the most common procedure. Mean cost per patient increased from '4,471.22 in 2001 to '5,562.54 (P < .05) in 2011. Factors related to the incidence of hospitalizations were age, sex and year of study in the multivariate analysis. Conclusions We found a decrease in the rate of hospitalizations in men and an increase in women, with a concomitant increase in comorbidities and cost; however, length of hospital stay decreased. Factors related to incidence of hospitalizations were age, sex and year of study.","['Palacio Nebreda, M.M.', 'de Miguel-Diez, J.', 'Villegas Fernández, F.R.', 'Segura Fragoso, A.', 'Rodríguez Calderón, J.L.', 'Martínez Hernández, D.']",10.1016/j.arbres.2016.01.020
Lung cancer and urbanization level in a region of Southern Europe: influence of socio-economic and environmental factors,"BACKGROUND: This study analysed the distribution of lung cancer deaths in areas with different urbanization levels in the Madrid Region and whether such differences persisted when deprivation and air pollution were considered. METHODS: This was a population-based cross-sectional study covering lung cancer deaths (2001-07). The exposure indicators were: a deprivation index based on 2001 census data; and the daily mean NO2 measurement (2002-07), both at the census tract level. Analysis was stratified by sex and age group and the Poisson regression models were applied to obtain rate ratios (RRs). RESULTS: After adjustment for age, deprivation index and NO2, mortality was similar in the city and Greater Madrid areas and lower in the rural area for the over-64 age group (RR: 0.84 in men and RR: 0.66 in women, with respect to the city of Madrid), and significantly lower in the Greater Madrid area (RR: 0.84 in men and RR: 0.74 in women) and in the rural area (RR: 0.73 in men and RR: 0.51 in women) with respect to the city of Madrid for the under-65 age group.

The Natural History of Operable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the National Cancer Database,"Background: The survival of untreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), or the natural history, is an important perspective for patients considering resection for NSCLC. The National Cancer Database (NCDB) allows untreated NSCLC patients who were recommended to undergo surgical resection (ie, “operable”) to be identified. The survival of untreated NSCLC patients in the NCDB was studied to determine the natural history of operable NSCLC. Methods: The NCDB was queried for untreated clinical stage I to IIIA NSCLC patients diagnosed between 2003 and 2009. The natural history cohort was defined as patients who were recommended to undergo resection but went untreated. Results: We identified 1,693 untreated patients with operable NSCLC. The median survival for clinical stage I, II, and IIIA was 16.6, 9.4, and 8.4 months, respectively. The 5-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival for clinical stage I, II, and IIIA NSCLC were 10.1%, 7.3%, and 4.9%, respectively. At each stage (I to IIIA), the survival of untreated operable NSCLC patients was superior to that of untreated NSCLC patients not recommended to undergo resection (nonoperable, p < 0.001). A multivariable Cox regression model identified increasing age, male gender, white (vs black) race, increasing comorbidity, squamous cell or large cell histology, and increasing stage as predictors of decreased survival. Conclusions: The natural history of operable NSCLC, although poor, varies with clinical stage and is superior to that of nonoperable NSCLC.","['Rosen, J.E.', 'Keshava, H.B.', 'Yao, X.', 'Kim, A.W.', 'Detterbeck, F.C.', 'Boffa, D.J.']",10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.01.077
The global decrease in cancer mortality: Trends and disparities,"Background: A decrease in cancer mortality has been reported in the United States, Europe, and other high-income regions during the last two decades. Whether similar trends apply to low-to-middle income countries-and globally-is unclear. Design: The aim of this descriptive study is to compare cancer mortality in all countries with high- or intermediate-quality data on death certificates according to the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database for the years 2000 through 2010. We included 60 countries in the analysis and calculated age-adjusted mortality rates for all cancer combined and for the commonest cancers worldwide: lung, stomach, breast, colorectal, uterine, and prostate. Results: A decrease in overall cancer mortality rate of ~1% per year was observed in higher and lower income regions and in both sexes. In 2010, 696 000 cancer deaths were avoided on a global scale compared with 2000 rates (426 000 in men, 271 000 in women). However, the mortality of liver cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in females increased in many countries'. Conclusions: The individual risk of dying from cancer decreased in all countries with reliable data. This decrease was chiefly due to favorable trends in the commonest specific cancers. Liver cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in women, which show increasing mortality rates, constitute a priority for prevention and further research.","['Hashim, D.', 'Boffetta, P.', 'La Vecchia, C.', 'Rota, M.', 'Bertuccio, P.', 'Malvezzi, M.', 'Negri, E.']",10.1093/annonc/mdw027
"Lung cancer treatment and mortality for Aboriginal people in New South Wales, Australia: Results from a population-based record linkage study and medical record audit","Background: The aim of this study was to compare surgical treatment received by Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in New South Wales (NSW), Australia and to examine whether patient and disease characteristics are associated with any disparities found. An additional objective was to describe the adjuvant treatments received by Aboriginal people diagnosed with NSCLC in NSW. Finally, we compared the risk of death from NSCLC for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. Methods: We used logistic regression and competing risks regression to analyse population-based cancer registry records for people diagnosed with NSCLC in NSW, 2001-2007, linked to hospital inpatient episodes and deaths. We also analysed treatment patterns from a medical record audit for 170 Aboriginal people diagnosed with NSCLC in NSW, 2000-2010. Results: Of 20,154 people diagnosed with primary lung cancer, 341 (1.7%) were Aboriginal. Larger proportions of Aboriginal people were younger, female, living outside major cities or in areas of greater socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking at the time of diagnosis and had comorbidities. Although Aboriginal people were, on average, younger at diagnosis with non-metastatic NSCLC than non-Aboriginal people, only 30.8% of Aboriginal people received surgery, compared with 39.5% of non-Aboriginal people. Further, Aboriginal people who were not receiving surgery, at the time of diagnosis, were more likely to be younger, live in major cities and have no comorbidities. The observed risk of death from NSCLC 5 years after diagnosis was higher for 266 Aboriginal people (83.3% 95% CI 77.5-87.7) than for 15,491 non-Aboriginal people (77.6% 95% CI 76.9-78.3) and the adjusted subhazard ratio was 1.32 (95% CI 1.14-1.52). From the medical record audit, 29% of Aboriginal people with NSCLC had potentially curative treatment, 45% had palliative radiotherapy/chemotherapy and 26% had no active treatment. Conclusions: There are disparities in NSCLC surgical treatment and mortality for Aboriginal people compared with non-Aboriginal people in NSW. It is imperative that Aboriginal people are offered active lung cancer treatment, particularly those who are younger and without comorbidities and are therefore most likely to benefit, and are provided with assistance to access it if required.","['Gibberd, A.', 'Supramaniam, R.', 'Dillon, A.', 'Armstrong, B.K.', ""O'Connell, D.L.""]",10.1186/s12885-016-2322-1
Regional inequalities in lung cancer mortality in Belgium at the beginning of the 21st century: The contribution of individual and area-level socioeconomic status and industrial exposure,"Being a highly industrialized country with one of the highest male lung cancer mortality rates in Europe, Belgium is an interesting study area for lung cancer research. This study investigates geographical patterns in lung cancer mortality in Belgium. More specifically it probes into the contribution of individual as well as area-level characteristics to (sub-district patterns in) lung cancer mortality. Data from the 2001 census linked to register data from 2001-2011 are used, selecting all Belgian inhabitants aged 65+ at time of the census. Individual characteristics include education, housing status and home ownership. Urbanicity, unemployment rate, the percentage employed in mining and the percentage employed in other high-risk industries are included as sub-district characteristics. Regional variation in lung cancer mortality at sub-district level is estimated using directly age-standardized mortality rates. The association between lung cancer mortality and individual and area characteristics, and their impact on the variation of sub-district level is estimated using multilevel Poisson models. Significant sub-district variations in lung cancer mortality are observed. Individual characteristics explain a small share of this variation, while a large share is explained by sub-district characteristics. Individuals with a low socioeconomic status experience a higher lung cancer mortality risk. Among women, an association with lung cancer mortality is found for the sub-district characteristics urbanicity and unemployment rate, while for men lung cancer mortality was associated with the percentage employed in mining. Not just individual characteristics, but also area characteristics are thus important determinants of (regional differences in) lung cancer mortality.","['Hagedoorn, P.', 'Vandenheede, H.', 'Willaert, D.', 'Vanthomme, K.', 'Gadeyne, S.']",10.1371/journal.pone.0147099
Treatment patterns and survival in patients with ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer: A Canadian retrospective study,"Background Crizotinib was the first agent approved for the treatment of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)– positive (+) non-small-cell lung cancer (nsclc), followed by ceritinib. However, patients eventually progress or develop resistance to crizotinib. With limited real-world data available, the objective of the present work was to evaluate treatment patterns and survival after crizotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK+ nsclc in Canada. Methods In this retrospective study at 6 oncology centres across Canada, medical records of patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK+ nsclc were reviewed. Demographic and clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes data were abstracted. Analyses focused on patients who discontinued crizotinib treatment. Results Of the 97 patients included, 9 were crizotinib-naïve, and 39 were still receiving crizotinib at study end. The 49 patients who discontinued crizotinib treatment were included in the analysis. Of those 49 patients, 43% received ceritinib at any time, 20% subsequently received systemic chemotherapy only (but never ceritinib), and 37% received no further treatment or died before receiving additional treatment. Median overall survival from crizotinib discontinuation was shorter in patients who did not receive ceritinib than in those who received ceritinib (1.7 months vs. 20.4 months, p < 0.001). In a multivariable analysis, factors associated with poorer survival included lack of additional therapies (particularly ceritinib), male sex, and younger age, but not smoking status; patients of Asian ethnicity showed a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival. Conclusions A substantial proportion of patients with ALK+ nsclc received no further treatment or died before receiving additional treatment after crizotinib. Treatment with systemic agents was associated with improved survival, with ceritinib use being associated with the longest survival.","['Kayaniyil, S.', 'Hurry, M.', 'Wilson, J.', 'Wheatley-Price, P.', 'Melosky, B.', 'Rothenstein, J.', 'Cohen, V.', 'Koch, C.', 'Zhang, J.', 'Osenenko, K.', 'Liu, G.']",10.3747/co.23.3273
Associations of Most Prevalent Risk Factors with Lung Cancer and Their Impact on Survival Length,"Lung cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the world. Its incidence and mortality rates are on the rise in Pakistan. However, epidemiological studies to identify common lung cancer determinants in the Pakistani population have been limited. In this study, data of 440 cases and 323 controls were collected from different hospitals in Peshawar and Islamabad, along with information about socio-demographic factors including age, sex and smoking. Univariate and multi-factorial analyses of socio-demographic factors in association with each other were also performed. Overall survival analysis highlighted that, out of 440 patients in the lung cancer dataset, 204 people were uncensored with a median survival time of 13 months (95% CI=12-18). There were 41 femaleand 399 male patients. Differences were observed between length of survival in the males and females (χ12 = 6.1; p-value = 0.01). Gender was observed to be significantly related to survival (p-value< 0.01), with better survival in females (hazard ratio=2). Cox regression was extended to adjust for the covariate age (z = 2.5; p-value = 0.02). Survival analysis was also performed on the basis of smoking groups (current smokers, former smokers and never smoked individuals) and smoking duration (smoking duration>10 years, <10 years and never smoked). Smoking duration was significantly associated with survival (p-value < 0.01), with better survival in never smokers in comparison to both smoking for greater or less than 10 years. Strong associations were observed for smoking group with duration greater than 10 years, OR=6.1(3.9-9.5) on univariate and multi-factorial analysis OR=11.3(CI=6.8-19.3).","['Haroon Khan, M.', 'Hussain, S.', 'Bano, R.', 'Jamshed-Ul-Hassan, H.', 'Aadil Ur Rehman, M.']",
Predictors of High eHealth Literacy in Primary Lung Cancer Survivors,"Lung cancer survivors are likely to have low health literacy which is an independent risk factor for poorer health outcomes. The eHealth literacy in lung cancer survivors has not been reported. The purposes of this study were to determine self-perceived eHealth literacy levels in lung cancer survivors and to explore predictors of higher eHealth literacy. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, Canada. Survivors completed a survey that collected demographic, self-perceived eHealth literacy (using the eHealth Literacy Scale), and quality of life information. Tumor and treatment details were extracted from medical records. Demographic data was summarized using descriptive statistics and compared against those with high and low eHealth literacy using Fisher's exact test. Eighty-three survivors were enrolled over 7 months. Median age was 71 years (range 44-89); 41 survivors (49%) were male. Forty-six (55%) survivors had some college education or higher. Most had access to eResources (78%) via computer, Internet, or smartphone. Fifty-seven (69%) scored 5 or greater (7=excellent) on the overall health scale. Twenty-eight (33.7%) perceived themselves to have high eHealth literacy. There was no statistically significant correlation between eHealth literacy groups and age (p=1.00), gender (p=0.82), living situation (p=1.00), overall health (p=1.00), overall quality of life (QoL) (p=1.00), or histology (p=0.74). High eHealth literacy correlated with the level of education received (p=0.003) and access to eResources (p=0.004). The self-perceived eHealth literacy of lung cancer survivors is generally low.","['Milne, R.A.', 'Puts, M.T.', 'Papadakos, J.', 'Le, L.W.', 'Milne, V.C.', 'Hope, A.J.', 'Catton, P.', 'Giuliani, M.E.']",10.1007/s13187-014-0744-5
Cachexia index in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients,"Introduction: Cancer cachexia affects many advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Cachexia index (CXI) was developed to assess the degree of cachexia in these patients. Methods: Patients with metastatic NSCLC diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and June 30, 2011, at our institution were retrospectively studied. Abdominal computed tomography scans done within 1 month of diagnosis were reviewed to estimate skeletal muscle area (SMA) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) at the L3 level. CXI was developed as follows: CXI=(SMI × Alb)/NLR where SMI is the skeletal muscle index, Alb is the serum albumin, and NLR is the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Survival among various factors was calculated using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression was used to perform survival analysis in order to estimate the effects of various factors. Results: Patients were divided into two groups around the median into stage I cachexia (CXI ≥35, n = 56) and stage II cachexia (CXI <35, n = 56). Groups did not differ in age, gender, ethnicity, or histology of cancer. Patients with stage II cachexia had significantly worse PFS (2.45 vs 5.43 months, P < 0.0001) and OS (3.45 vs 8.8 months, P = 0.0001) than those with stage I cachexia. On multivariate analysis adjusting for gender, race, and histology, patients with stage II cachexia were found to have worse PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.27–2.95) and OS (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.0009–2.34). Conclusion: The CXI is a novel index for estimating cachexia that also correlates with prognosis in both men and women with advanced NSCLC.","['Jafri, S.H.R.', 'Previgliano, C.', 'Khandelwal, K.', 'Shi, R.']",10.4137/CMO.S30891
"Disparities in Cancer Incidence, Stage, and Mortality at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program","Introduction Homeless people have a high burden of cancer risk factors and suboptimal rates of cancer screening, but the epidemiology of cancer has not been well described in this population. We assessed cancer incidence, stage, and mortality in homeless adults relative to general population standards. Methods We cross-linked a cohort of 28,033 adults seen at Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program in 2003-2008 to Massachusetts cancer registry and vital registry records. We calculated age-standardized cancer incidence and mortality ratios (SIRs and SMRs). We examined tobacco use among incident cases and estimated smoking-attributable fractions. Trend tests were used to compare cancer stage distributions with those in Massachusetts adults. Analyses were conducted in 2012-2015. Results During 90,450 person-years of observation, there were 361 incident cancers (SIR=1.13, 95% CI=1.02, 1.25) and 168 cancer deaths (SMR=1.88, 95% CI=1.61, 2.19) among men, and 98 incident cancers (SIR=0.93, 95% CI=0.76, 1.14) and 38 cancer deaths (SMR=1.61, 95% CI=1.14, 2.20) among women. For both sexes, bronchus and lung cancer was the leading type of incident cancer and cancer death, exceeding Massachusetts estimates more than twofold. Oropharyngeal and liver cancer cases and deaths occurred in excess among men, whereas cervical cancer cases and deaths occurred in excess among women. About one third of incident cancers were smoking-attributable. Colorectal, female breast, and oropharyngeal cancers were diagnosed at more-advanced stages than in Massachusetts adults. Conclusions Efforts to reduce cancer disparities in homeless people should include addressing tobacco use and enhancing participation in evidence-based screening.","['Baggett, T.P.', 'Chang, Y.', 'Porneala, B.C.', 'Bharel, M.', 'Singer, D.E.', 'Rigotti, N.A.']",10.1016/j.amepre.2015.03.038
"Different mutation profiles and clinical characteristics among Hispanic patients with non-small cell lung cancer could explain the ""Hispanic paradox""","Objective: Sixteen percent of US population is Hispanic, mostly Mexican. Recently, two independent American reports demonstrated a higher overall survival (OS) in Hispanic populations compared with non-Hispanic-white populations (NHW) with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), even when most Hispanic patients are diagnosed at advanced disease stages and have lower income status. We analyzed the clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics as well as outcomes in a cohort of NSCLC Hispanic patients from the National Cancer Institute of Mexico that could explain this ""Hispanic Paradox"". Material and methods: A cohort of 1260 consecutive NSCLC patients treated at the National Cancer Institute of Mexico from 2007 to 2014 was analyzed. Their clinical-pathological characteristics, the presence of EGFR and KRAS mutations and the prognosis were evaluated. Results: Patients presented with disease stages II, IIIa, IIIb and IV at rates of 0.6, 4.8, 18.4 and 76.3%, respectively. NSCLC was associated with smoking in only 56.5% of the patients (76.7% of male vs 33.0% of female patients). Wood smoke exposure (WSE) was associated with 37.2% of the cases (27.3% in men vs 48.8% in women). The frequency of EGFR mutations was 27.0% (18.5% in males vs 36.9% in females, p < 0.001) and the frequency for KRAS mutations was 10.5% (10.3% men vs 10.1% in women p = 0.939). The median OS for all patients was 23.0 [95% CI 19.4-26.2], whereas for patients at stage IV, it was 18.5 months [95% CI 15.2-21.8]. The independent factors associated with the OS were the ECOG, disease stage, EGFR and KRAS mutation status. Conclusion: The high frequency of EGFR mutations and low frequency of KRAS mutations in Hispanic populations and different prevalence in lung cancer-related-developing risk factors compared with Caucasian populations, such as the lower frequency of smoking exposure and higher WSE, particularly in women, might explain the prognosis differences between foreign-born-Hispanics, US-born-Hispanics and NHWs.","['Arrieta, O.', 'Ramírez-Tirado, L.-A.', 'Báez-Saldaña, R.', 'Peña-Curiel, O.', 'Soca-Chafre, G.', 'Macedo-Perez, E.-O.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2015.08.010
A Pilot Study of Self-Reported Physical Activity and Eating Habits in Turkish Cancer Patients under Chemotherapy,"As in all individuals, improving the quality of life, balanced nutrition and physical activity habits must be acquired in cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to determine eating habits and physical activity of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Sixty-six patients were completed the questionnaire included sociodemographic data, type of cancer, anthropometric measurements (size and body weight), dietary and physical activity habits. Body mass index for each patient was calculated. Data were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science software. Patients were ranged from underweight to obese according to their body mass index: 6.1% of patients were classified as underweight. Almost half (48.5%, n = 32) reported to be regularly physical active, and 46.9% (n = 15) thereof reported 30 min brisk walking. More vegetables consumption was the most popular answer with 62.1% (n = 41), whereas vegetables/fruit or vegetables/legume consumption was 22.7% (n = 15). Gender differences in food choice and preferring the taste of food were not seen as statistically significant. In this article, patients with different types of cancer reported their eating habits and physical activity. Disease-related and worse prognostic factors were found. An institutional program should be offered to cancer patients for consulting about nutrition and physical activity.","['Gunes-Bayir, A.', 'Kiziltan, H.S.', 'Sentürk, N.', 'Mayadagl, A.', 'Gumus, M.']",10.1080/01635581.2015.1053500
Effect of race and insurance on the outcome of stage I non-small cell lung cancer,"Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of death in the United States, with reported inferior survival among African-Americans. Patients and Methods: Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to compare survival outcomes of 569 patients diagnosed with stage I non-small cell lung cancer from 2001-2010. Results: African-Americans and Whites differed significantly by age, sex, and insurance type. The median follow-up was 2.3 years. The 2-, 5- and 8-year overall survival was 72%, 47%, and 38%, respectively. Age, stage, insurance type, and surgery were significant predictors of overall survival which remained significant after adjusting for other variables, including race, gender, histology, smoking history, treatment era, chemotherapy or radiotherapy which were not. Conclusion: Insurance status but not race is an important predictor of survival in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer.","['Biswas, T.', 'Walker, P.', 'Podder, T.', 'Efird, J.T.']",
The effect of gender on health-related quality of life and related factors in post-lobectomy lung-cancer patients,"PURPOSE: While studies have documented gender differences by histologic type among lung cancer patients, the effect of these differences on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of post-lobectomy lungcancer patients and related factors remain uncertain. This study examines gender-specific HRQoL and related factors in post-lobectomy lung-cancer patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was applied. A convenience sample of 231 post-lobectomy lungcancer patients was recruited from the thoracic surgery outpatient departments of two teaching hospitals in Taipei, Taiwan from March to December 2012. Patients performed a spirometry test and completed instruments that included a Beck Depression Inventory-II, an Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, and the symptom and function scales of the Quality of Life Questionnaire. Data analysis used descriptive statistics, including mean and standard deviations, frequency, and percentage values. Independent-sample Student's t-tests and multivariate analyses were used for comparative purposes. RESULTS: This study confirmed a significant gender effect on HRQoL and HRQoL-related factors such as marital status, religious affiliation, smoking status, histologic type, symptoms, pulmonary function, depression, and family support. Moreover, multivariate analysis found gender to be a significant determinant of the HRQoL aspects of physical functioning, emotional functioning, and cognitive functioning. Finally, results indicated that factors other than gender were also significant determinants of HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Gender impacts the HRQoL and related factors of postoperative lung-cancer patients. Therefore, gender should be considered in assessing and addressing the individual care needs of these patients in order to attain optimal treatment outcomes.","['Chang, N.-W.', 'Lin, K.-C.', 'Hsu, W.-H.', 'Lee, S.-C.', 'Chan, J.Y.-H.', 'Wang, K.-Y.']",10.1016/j.ejon.2014.10.015
Comparisons of the clinicopathological features and survival outcomes between lung cancer patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma,"Objective: Patients with lung cancer should be treated according to histological subtype because of the disparities in tumor aggressiveness and treatment responses. It is important to re-evaluate the clinicopathological features of the two major subtypes of lung cancer, adenocarcinoma (AD) and squamous cell carcinoma (SQ). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed data on the clinicopathological features and outcomes of 2059 patients with pulmonary AD and pulmonary SQ who had undergone complete resection at Nagoya University Hospital and Aichi Cancer Center between 1995 and 2012. Results: The cohort consisted of 1587 patients with AD (77 %) and 472 with SQ (23 %). Female gender, no history of smoking, and small tumor size were distinct characteristics of AD patients, and a higher age was a characteristic of SQ patients (p < 0.0001). A significant difference was observed in overall survival, with 5-year survival rates of 78 % in AD patients and 63 % in SQ patients. Patients with stage IA and IB SQ had significantly worse outcomes than patients with AD at the same stage (p < 0.0001). Because no survival difference was observed between SQ patients with stage IA, IB, and IIA tumors (p = 0.75), these patients were considered to have proposed stage IIA disease. Then, comparable survival curves were obtained between stages II and IIIA SQ and AD. Conclusions: Patients with stage I SQ had significantly worse outcomes than patients with stage I AD. A newly defined stage grouping for SQ patients provided outcomes comparable to those of AD patients.","['Fukui, T.', 'Taniguchi, T.', 'Kawaguchi, K.', 'Fukumoto, K.', 'Nakamura, S.', 'Sakao, Y.', 'Yokoi, K.']",10.1007/s11748-015-0564-5
Patterns and predictors of antidepressant use in ambulatory cancer patients with common solid tumors,"Abstract Purpose Depressive symptoms and antidepressant use are prevalent among cancer patients. We sought to identify determinants of prescribing commonly used antidepressants. Patients and methods This multi-institutional study enrolled 3106 ambulatory patients with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon/rectum, or lung. Five case-finding methods were used to identify patients with depressive symptoms. Logistic models were used to examine factors that impact antidepressant use. Results Approximately, 47% of patients were defined as having depressive symptoms. Clinicians rated being sad/depressed as one of the top three priority problems for 10.5% of patients. Antidepressants were prescribed in 19% of all patients, 25% with depressive symptoms and 14% nondepressed patients. After adjusting for other covariates, these variable categories were significantly associated with greater use of antidepressants: depressive symptoms, family history of depression, concurrent medication use, cancer treatment status, and certain other clinical and demographic variables. The strongest individual predictors were concurrent use of more than 10 medications (odds ratio [OR] = 3.3), a family history of depression (OR = 2.2), sedative use (OR = 2.1), non-Hispanic white race (OR = 2.0), and anxiolytics use (OR = 2.0). Conclusions Depressive symptoms are found in nearly half of outpatients with cancer, and one-fourth of patients with depressive symptoms are taking an antidepressant. Patients receiving antidepressants are more often those taking multiple medications, those with a depression diathesis, and those with more extensive cancer treatment. Patients who were younger, white, and female were also more likely to be taking antidepressants.","['Fisch, M.J.', 'Zhao, F.', 'Manola, J.', 'Miller, A.H.', 'Pirl, W.F.', 'Wagner, L.I.']",10.1002/pon.3606
Postoperative radiotherapy for pathologic N2 non-small-cell lung cancer treated with adjuvant chemotherapy: A review of the national cancer data base,"Purpose To investigate the impact of modern postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on overall survival (OS) for patients with N2 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated nationally with surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients and Methods Patients with pathologic N2 NSCLC who underwent complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy from 2006 to 2010 were identified from the National Cancer Data Base and stratified by use of PORT (≥ 45 Gy). A total of 4,483 patients were identified (PORT, n = 1,850; no PORT, n =2,633). The impact of patient and treatment variables on OS was explored using Cox regression. Results Median follow-up time was 22 months. On univariable analysis, improved OS correlated with younger age, treatment at an academic facility, female sex, urban population, higher income, lower Charlson comorbidity score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT. On multivariable analysis, improved OS remained independently predicted by younger age, female sex, urban population, lower Charlson score, smaller tumor size, multiagent chemotherapy, resection with at least a lobectomy, and PORT (hazard ratio, 0.886; 95% CI, 0.798 to 0.988). Use of PORT was associated with an increase in median and 5-year OS compared with no PORT (median OS, 45.2 v 40.7 months, respectively; 5-year OS, 39.3% [95% CI, 35.4% to 43.5%] v 34.8% [95% CI, 31.6% to 38.3%], respectively; P = .014). Conclusion For patients with N2 NSCLC after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, modern PORT seems to confer an additional OS advantage beyond that achieved with adjuvant chemotherapy alone.","['Robinson, C.G.', 'Patel, A.P.', 'Bradley, J.D.', 'DeWees, T.', 'Waqar, S.N.', 'Morgensztern, D.', 'Baggstrom, M.Q.', 'Govindan, R.', 'Bell, J.M.', 'Guthrie, T.J.', 'Colditz, G.A.', 'Crabtree, T.D.', 'Kreisel, D.', 'Krupnick, A.S.', 'Patterson, G.A.', 'Meyers, B.F.', 'Puri, V.']",10.1200/JCO.2014.58.5380
Potentially preventable premature lung cancer deaths in the USA if overall population rates were reduced to those of educated whites in lower-risk states,"Purpose: Death rates for lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in the USA, vary substantially by the level of education at the national level, but this has not previously been analyzed by state. Methods: We examined age-standardized lung cancer death rates by educational attainment, race/ethnicity, and state in men and women (aged 25–64 years) in the USA in 2008–2010 and estimated the proportion of potentially avoidable premature lung cancer deaths for each state if rates were reduced to those achieved among more educated non-Hispanic whites in five states with low lung cancer rates, using data on 134,869 lung cancer deaths. Results: Age-standardized lung cancer mortality rates differed substantially by state and education level. Among non-Hispanic white men, for example, rates per 100,000 ranged from below 6 in more educated men (≥16 years of education) in Utah, Colorado, and Montana to >75 in less educated men (≤12 years of education) in Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Kentucky. An estimated 73 % of lung cancer deaths in the USA (32,700 deaths annually in 25- to 64-year-old individuals alone) would be prevented. This proportion was ≥85 % among men in Arkansas, Alabama, Kentucky, and Mississippi, and ≥80 % among women in West Virginia and Kentucky. Conclusion: Most premature lung cancer deaths in the USA are potentially avoidable. As most of these deaths can be attributed to smoking, our findings underscore the importance of increasing tobacco control measures in high-risk states and targeting tobacco control interventions to less educated populations in all states.","['Islami, F.', 'Ward, E.M.', 'Jacobs, E.J.', 'Ma, J.', 'Goding Sauer, A.', 'Lortet-Tieulent, J.', 'Jemal, A.']",10.1007/s10552-014-0517-9
Non-small-cell lung cancer clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes in Asian pacific islanders residing in the united states: A SEER analysis,"Background. The objective of our study was to ascertain racial/ethnic disparities in Asian/Pacific Islanders (API) for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinicopathologic features and survival outcomes based on various tumor characteristics and treatment modalities. Method. SEER database identified invasive NSCLC cases from 2004 to 2010. Variables included American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage 7, tumor grade, tumor size, histology, age, marital status, radiation, surgery, and reason for no surgery. The Kruskall-Wallis test and the Z test were used to examine differences between races/ethnicities and the referent, non-Hispanic white (NHW). Multivariate Cox proportional analyses were used to establish the weight of the prognostic significance contributing to disease-specific survival (DSS) in each AJCC stage. Result. Improved DSS was seen in API across stage I (HR: 0.78), stage II (HR: 0.79), and stage IV (HR: 0.86), respectively, compared to the referent NHW (P < 0.01). Prognosis was improved by being married, being female gender, AIS histology, and birth outside the US (P < 0.01). Conclusion. We have demonstrated improved survival among API in early stage and stage IV NSCLC. Further research is necessary to clarify the role of lifestyle and tumor biology for these differences.","['Hamid, M.S.', 'Shameem, R.', 'Gafoor, K.', 'George, J.', 'Mina, B.', 'Sullivan, K.']",10.1155/2015/269304
Racial and Ethnic Differences in Lung Cancer Surgical Stage: An STS Database Study,"Background Racial and ethnic differences in lung cancer care have been previously documented. These differences may be related to access to care, cultural differences, or fewer patients presenting with operable lung cancer. The relationship between race and pathologic stage of patients who undergo lung cancer resection has not been defined. This study estimates racial disparities in lung cancer stage among patients who undergo surgical resection. Methods The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database was queried for patients who underwent resection of non-small cell lung cancer and had complete pathologic staging and racial identification. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Study end point was the pathologic stage and we evaluated its association with the racial and ethnic origins of the patients. Results Of 19,173 eligible patients with non-small cell lung cancer of known pathological stage who underwent surgery between 2002 and 2008, the majority were Caucasian (17,148, 89.4%), 1,502 (7.8%) were African-American, 273 (1.4%) were Asian, and 250 (1.3%) were Hispanic. In univariate analysis, significantly more Caucasian and African-American patients underwent resection of stage I/II lung cancer (13,929, 81.2% and 1,217, 81%, respectively) as compared with the Asian (207, 75.2%) and Hispanic (188, 75.8%) patients (p = 0.007). Stage at operation did not differ between Caucasians and African-Americans. Multivariate analysis confirmed these findings (p = 0.03) after adjustment for age, gender, tobacco use, diabetes, and year of surgery. Conclusion Within the STS database, patients identified as Asian or Hispanic had a significantly higher pathologic stage at the time of resection than Caucasian or African-American patients. The causes of these differences in the treatment of potentially curable lung cancer are unknown and require further investigation.","['Weksler, B.', 'Kosinski, A.S.', 'Burfeind, W.R.', 'Silvestry, S.C.', 'Sullivan, J.', ""D'Amico, T.A.""]",10.1055/s-0035-1546295
Improvement in population-based survival of stage IV NSCLC due to increased use of chemotherapy,"This study aimed to investigate which factors were associated with the administration of chemotherapy for patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and their relation to survival at a population-based level. All patients with NSCLC stage IV from 2001 to 2012 were identified in the Netherlands Cancer Registry in the Eindhoven area (n = 5,428). Chemotherapy use and survival were evaluated by logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy increased from 30% in 2001 to 48% in 2012. Higher rates were found among younger patients [multivariable odds ratio (OR≤64 vs ≥75 years):1.8 (95%CI 1.6-2.1)], high socioeconomic status [ORhigh vs.-low: 1.8 (95%CI 1.6-2.2)], no comorbidity [OR0 vs.-≥2: 1.5 (95%CI 1.3-1.8)], diagnosed in recent years [OR2010-2012-vs.-2001-2003: 2.0 (95%CI 1.6-2.3)] and adenocarcinoma [ORsquamousvs. adenocarcinoma: 0.8 (95%CI 0.6-0.9)]. Having liver metastasis was associated with reduced odds (ORliver vs brain: 0.8 (95%CI 0.7-1.0). The variation between hospitals was large, up to OR 2.0 (95%CI 1.5-2.6). Median survival increased from 18 weeks in 2001-2003 to 21 weeks in 2010-2012 (log-rank p = 0.007), and was 35 weeks in patients with and 10 weeks without chemotherapy. The multivariable hazard of death reduced significantly over time [HR2001-2003-vs.-2010-2012: 1.1 (95%CI 1.0-1.2), HR2004-2005-vs.-2010-2012: 1.2 (95%CI 1.1-1.3)] and only remained significant for 2004-2006 after additional adjustment for chemotherapy [final multivariable model, HR2004-2006-vs.-2010-2012: 1.1 (95%CI 1.0-1.2)]. Besides, prognostic factors were having chemotherapy [final multivariable model: HR 0.4 (95%CI 0.4-0.4)], female sex [HRmale-vs.-female: 1.1 (95%CI 1.0-1.1)], socioeconomic status [HRintermediate-and-high-vs.-low both 0.9 (95%CI 0.9-1.0)], comorbidity [HRunknown vs ≥2: 1.3 (95%CI 1.2-1.5)], histology [HRother-vs.-adenocarcinoma: 1.1 (95%CI 1.1-1.2)], and location of metastasis [range: 1.2 (HRlymph nodes-vs.-brain) 2 1.6 (HRliver-vs.-brain)]. In conclusion, population-based survival increased due to increasing administration rates of chemotherapy. The administration of chemotherapy was affected by hospital of diagnosis and both patient and tumour characteristics. Identifying patients who benefit from chemotherapy should become a key issue.","['Aarts, M.J.', 'Van Den Borne, B.E.', 'Biesma, B.', 'Kloover, J.S.', 'Aerts, J.G.', 'Lemmens, V.E.P.P.']",10.1002/ijc.29216
"Cancer survival in China, 2003-2005: A population-based study","Limited population-based cancer registry data available in China until now has hampered efforts to inform cancer control policy. Following extensive efforts to improve the systematic cancer surveillance in this country, we report on the largest pooled analysis of cancer survival data in China to date. Of 21 population-based cancer registries, data from 17 registries (n5138,852 cancer records) were included in the final analysis. Cases were diagnosed in 2003-2005 and followed until the end of 2010. Age-standardized relative survival was calculated using region-specific life tables for all cancers combined and 26 individual cancers. Estimates were further stratified by sex and geographical area. The age-standardized 5-year relative survival for all cancers was 30.9% (95% confidence intervals: 30.6%-31.2%). Female breast cancer had high survival (73.0%) followed by cancers of the colorectum (47.2%), stomach (27.4%), esophagus (20.9%), with lung and liver cancer having poor survival (16.1% and 10.1%), respectively. Survival for women was generally higher than for men. Survival for rural patients was about half that of their urban counterparts for all cancers combined (21.8% vs. 39.5%); the pattern was similar for individual major cancers except esophageal cancer. The poor population survival rates in China emphasize the urgent need for government policy changes and investment to improve health services. While the causes for the striking urban-rural disparities observed are not fully understood, increasing access of health service in rural areas and providing basic health-care to the disadvantaged populations will be essential for reducing this disparity in the future.","['Zeng, H.', 'Zheng, R.', 'Guo, Y.', 'Zhang, S.', 'Zou, X.', 'Wang, N.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Tang, J.', 'Chen, J.', 'Wei, K.', 'Huang, S.', 'Wang, J.', 'Yu, L.', 'Zhao, D.', 'Song, G.', 'Chen, J.', 'Shen, Y.', 'Yang, X.', 'Gu, X.', 'Jin, F.', 'Li, Q.', 'Li, Y.', 'Ge, H.', 'Zhu, F.', 'Dong, J.', 'Guo, G.', 'Wu, M.', 'Du, L.', 'Sun, X.', 'He, Y.', 'Coleman, M.P.', 'Baade, P.', 'Chen, W.', 'Yu, X.Q.']",10.1002/ijc.29227
Symptom Expression in the Last Seven Days of Life among Cancer Patients Admitted to Acute Palliative Care Units,"Context The symptom burden in the last week of life of patients with advanced cancer has not been well characterized. Objectives To examine the frequency, intensity, and predictors for symptoms in the last seven days of life among patients who were able to communicate and died in an acute palliative care unit (APCU). Methods We systematically documented the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) daily and 15 symptoms twice daily on consecutive advanced cancer patients admitted to APCUs at MD Anderson Cancer Center (U.S.) and Barretos Cancer Hospital (Brazil) from admission to death or discharge in 2010/2011. We examined the frequency and intensity of the symptoms from death backward. Results A total of 203 of 357 patients died. The proportion of patients able to communicate decreased from 80% to 39% over the last seven days of life. ESAS anorexia (P = 0.001 in longitudinal analyses), drowsiness (P < 0.0001), fatigue (P < 0.0001), poor well-being (P = 0.01), and dyspnea (P < 0.0001) increased in intensity closer to death. In contrast, ESAS depression (P = 0.008) decreased over time. Dysphagia to solids (P = 0.01) and liquids (P = 0.005) as well as urinary incontinence (P = 0.0002) also were present in an increasing proportion of patients in the last few days of life. In multivariate analyses, female sex, non-Hispanic race, and lung cancer were significantly associated with higher ESAS symptom expression (odds ratio > 1). Conclusion Despite intensive management in APCUs, some cancer patients continue to experience high symptom burden as they approached death.","['Hui, D.', 'Dos Santos, R.', 'Chisholm, G.B.', 'Bruera, E.']",10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2014.09.003
Lung cancer in South Africa: A forecast to 2025 based on smoking prevalence data,"Objective: This study aims to forecast lung cancer mortality with respect to recent changes in smoking prevalence and compares the results to estimates from GLOBOCAN and the Global Burden of Disease study. Setting: An established epidemiological model is applied to detailed smoking prevalence data from South Africa to estimate lung cancer mortality from 2010 to 2025. Participants: Data from the South Africa Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2003 was analysed by sex and ethnic group, and combined with longitudinal estimates on smoking prevalence from 1980 to 2010. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Results provide detailed data on tobacco smoking behaviour by age, sex and ethnic group as well as modelled age-adjusted lung cancer mortality and number of yearly lung cancer deaths. Results: From 2010 to 2025, a decrease in age-adjusted lung cancer mortality is shown from 17.1 to 14.1 among men; whereas rates were stable around 7.2 among women. As a consequence, the estimated number of yearly lung cancer deaths is expected to increase slightly for men and more for women. With respect to ethnic groups, male mortality is expected to be highest for Asians and lowest for blacks. Female rates were lowest for Asians and highest for whites and for coloured. Conclusions: Mortality estimates of this study are close to the WHO mortality database and to Global Burden of Disease estimates for 2010, but significantly lower compared with GLOBOCAN estimates. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the impact of demographic changes and the positive effects of antismoking policy on lung cancer mortality in South Africa. Results may help decision makers to further improve smoking control.","['Winkler, V.', 'Mangolo, N.J.', 'Becher, H.']",10.1136/bmjopen-2014-006993
Taste alteration in patients receiving chemotherapy,"Objective: This study is aimed to determine factors that affect conditions of patients receiving chemotherapy in terms of experienced taste alteration. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study 184 patients receiving chemotherapy were included in the sample. Data were collected during the period of December 2013 to May 2014 using “Patient Characteristics Identification Form” and “Chemotherapy-induced Taste Alteration Scale (CiTAS).” Te data were analyzed using SPSS 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago IL, USA) statistical software in terms of number, percentage, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis H test. Results: Te mean age of the patients was 55.5±11.8 and 57.1% of them were female. The clinical diagnosis of the patients were most frequently breast cancer (n=46), colorectal cancer (n=45), and lung cancer (n=25). Furthermore, 37.5% of the patients were in clinical stage II; 15.8% of the patients received paclitaxel+herceptin and 14.1% received gemcitabine+cisplatin chemotherapy protocols. Data demonstrated significant differences in mean scores (p<0.05) taken from “Decline in Basic Taste” and “Phantogeusia and Parageusia” sub-scales with patients with or without xerostomia. There were significant diferences in the average scores of the subscales between those with and without a sore mouth “Discomfort” and “General taste alterations” (p<0.05). Conclusion: It has been established that patients receiving chemotherapy experience substantial alteration in taste by exposure of different subscales of CiTAS. Analysis of scores collected from different subscales of CiTAS with respect to sociodemographic and pathological differences showed that patients with xerostomia and sore mouth experienced more severe taste alterations.","['Sözeri, E.', 'Kutlutürkan, S.']",10.5152/tjbh.2015.2489
Impact of coexisting pulmonary diseases on survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma: A STROBE-compliant article,"Asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) are common pulmonary diseases associated with lung cancer. Besides, smoking is more prevalent in Taiwanese men. This study evaluated gender disparities in coexisting pulmonary diseases on survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer between 2003 and 2008 were identified from Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Cases with lung adenocarcinoma were further confirmed using the Cancer Registry Database and followed up until the end of 2010. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of coexisting asthma, COPD, and/or TB to estimate all-cause mortality risk. During the study period, 13,399 cases of lung adenocarcinoma were identified. The HRs of adenocarcinoma in men and women were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.30) and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.95-1.16), respectively, for individuals with asthma, 1.32 (95% CI, 1.16-1.51) and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.89-1.05), respectively, for COPD, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93-1.06) and 1.06 (95% CI, 0.86-1.32), respectively, for individuals with TB. Specifically, among men with coexisting pulmonary diseases, the HRs were 1.63 (95% CI, 1.25-2.13), 1.31 (95% CI, 1.08-1.59), and 1.23 (95% CI, 1.11-1.36) for individuals with asthma + COPD + TB, asthma + COPD, and COPD + TB, respectively. However, there was no increase risk of mortality among women with coexisting pulmonary diseases. Coexisting pulmonary diseases are at an elevated risk of mortality among male patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Such patients deserve greater attention while undergoing cancer treatment.","['Jian, Z.-H.', 'Huang, J.-Y.', 'Ko, P.-C.', 'Jan, S.-R.', 'Nfor, O.N.', 'Lung, C.-C.', 'Ku, W.-Y.', 'Ho, C.-C.', 'Pan, H.-H.', 'Liaw, Y.-P.']",10.1097/MD.0000000000000443
Gender-based impact of epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer and previous tuberculosis,"The association between tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer is well known. However, carcinogenesis of TB and its connection with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation remains unclear. This study aimed to determine this connection to see if TB can affect the outcome of patients with lung cancer. This is a retrospective cohort study of patients with lung cancer receiving EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) between 1996 and 2010 using the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Because therapeutic response was required to apply EGFR-TKIs for >90 days, only patients with a follow-up of >120 days were studied and a responder was defined as intake of EGFR-TKIs >90 days. Predictors of EGFR-TKI response and survival were identified using logistic and Cox regression analyses, respectively. There were 8265 patients analyzed, including 6073 (73.5%) EGFR-TKI responder and 2192 (26.5%) nonresponder. A history of TB was found in 1.2% and 1.8% of the 2 groups, respectively. Comparing to male with pulmonary TB history, female with or without pulmonary TB history and male without pulmonary TB history all had a better EGFR-TKI response and 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). Gender and TB history were not independent prognostic factors of 2-year overall survival. The findings were similar in the subpopulation without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancies other than lung cancer, and low-income status. TB has a gender-dependent impact, with better EGFR-TKI response and 1-year PFS in female patients with lung cancer. The carcinogenesis and inflammation of TB may be different between genders.","['Chang, C.-H.', 'Lee, C.-H.', 'Ho, C.-C.', 'Wang, J.-Y.', 'Yu, C.-J.']",10.1097/MD.0000000000000444
Disparities in perceived unmet need for supportive services among patients with lung cancer in the cancer care outcomes research and surveillance consortium,"BACKGROUND: The authors investigated the prevalence, determinants of, and disparities in any perceived unmet need for 8 supportive services (home nurse, support group, psychological services, social worker, physical/occupational rehabilitation, pain management, spiritual counseling, and smoking cessation) by race/ethnicity and nativity and how it is associated with perceived quality of care among US patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Data from a multiregional, multihealth system representative cohort of 4334 newly diagnosed patients were analyzed. Binomial logistic regression models adjusted for patient clustering. RESULTS: Patients with any perceived unmet need (9% overall) included 7% of white-US-born (USB), 9% of white-foreign-born (FB), 13% of black-USB, 8% of Latino-USB, 24% of Latino-FB, 4% of Asian/Pacific Islander (API)-USB, 14% of API-FB, and 11% of ""other"" patients (P<.001). Even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors, health system and health care access, and need, black-USB, Latino-FB, and Asian-FB patients were more likely to perceive an unmet need than white-USB patients by 5.1, 10.9, and 5.6 percentage points, respectively (all P<.05). Being younger, female, never married, uninsured, a current smoker, or under surrogate care or having comorbidity, anxiety/depression, or a cost/insurance barrier to getting tests/treatments were associated with any unmet need. Patients with any unmet need were more likely to rate care as less-than-""excellent"" by 13 percentage points than patients with no unmet need (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Significant disparities in unmet supportive service need by race/ethnicity and nativity highlight immigrants with lung cancer as being particularly underserved. Eliminating disparities in access to needed supportive services is essential for delivering patient-centered, equitable cancer care.","['John, D.A.', 'Kawachi, I.', 'Lathan, C.S.', 'Ayanian, J.Z.']",10.1002/cncr.28801
Educational inequalities in mortality by cause of death: first national data for the Netherlands,"OBJECTIVES: Using new facilities for linking large databases, we aimed to evaluate for the first time the magnitude of relative and absolute educational inequalities in mortality by sex and cause of death in the Netherlands. METHODS: We analyzed data from Dutch Labour Force Surveys (1998-2002) with mortality follow-up 1998-2007 among people aged 30-79 years. We calculated hazard ratios using Cox proportional hazards model, age-standardized mortality rates and partial life expectancy by education. We compared results for the Netherlands with those for other European countries. RESULTS: The relative risk of dying was about two times higher among primary educated men and women as compared to their tertiary educated counterparts, leading to a gap in partial life expectancy of 3.4 years (men) and 2.4 years (women). Inequalities in mortality are similar to those in other countries in North-Western Europe, but inequalities in lung cancer mortality are substantially larger in the Netherlands, particularly among men. CONCLUSIONS: The Netherlands has large inequalities in mortality, especially for smoking-related causes of death. These large inequalities require the urgent attention of policy makers.","['Kulhánová, I.', 'Hoffmann, R.', 'Eikemo, T.A.', 'Menvielle, G.', 'Mackenbach, J.P.']",10.1007/s00038-014-0576-4
"Lung cancer trends: Smoking, obesity, and sex assessed in the Staten Island University's lung cancer patients","Introduction: The incidence of lung cancer in the United States decreased by 1.8% from 1991 to 2005 while it increased by 0.5% in females. We assessed whether nonsmokers afflicted with lung cancer at Staten Island University Hospital are disproportionately female in comparison to national averages. We also evaluated different factors including race, histology, and body mass index (BMI) in correlation with smoking history. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted from 2005 to 2011 on 857 patients. Patients were divided into two groups according to their smoking status: current or ever-smokers, and former or never-smokers. A chi-square test for categorical data and multivariate logistic regression analyses was used to study the relation between BMI and the other clinical and demographic data. Results: Forty-nine percent of patients were men and 51% were women with a mean age at diagnosis of 67.8 years. Current smokers were most common (50.2%) followed by ever-smokers (18.2%), former smokers (15.8%) and never-smokers (15.6%). Forty eight percent had stage IV lung cancer upon presentation. Never-smokers with lung cancer were 24 times more likely to be females. However, the proportion of female former smokers (31.6%) was lower than the proportion of male former smokers (68.4%) (P=0.001). There was no significant association between American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, sex, race, and histological type in the two smoking groups. Current/ever-smokers tended to be younger at age of diagnosis (P=0.0003). BMI was lower in the current/ever-smokers (26.8 kg/m2) versus former/never-smokers (28.8) in males (P=0.0005). BMI was significantly higher in males (30.26) versus females (25.25) in the never-smoker category (P=0.004). Current smokers, compared to others, had a lower BMI in males (26.4 versus 28.3; P=0.0001) and females (25.5 versus 26.9; P=0.013) but the mean BMI for all groups was in the overweight/obese range. Conclusion: Our population of lung cancer patients although demographically distinct, reflects a similar proportion of afflicted nonsmokers to the national population. Smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, but there is also a possible direct correlation with BMI that would support obesity as a potential risk factor for lung cancer. © 2014 Gupta et al.","['Gupta, S.', 'Hassan, S.', 'Bhatt, V.R.', 'Abdul Sater, H.', 'Dilawari, A.']",10.2147/IJGM.S55806
Lung cancer incidence in Singapore: Ethnic and gender differences,"Objectives: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Singapore. We examine trends of lung cancer from 1968 to 2007, explore ethnic and gender-specific incidence rates, and examine period and cohort effects in Chinese and Malays using Age-Period-Cohort (APC) analysis. Methods: Aggregated data for cancer incidences and estimated person-years for the period 1968-2007 were obtained from the Singapore Cancer Registry. An APC analysis was performed using a Poisson regression model. Results: Lung cancer incidence rates were more than two times higher in males compared to females, and also higher in Chinese compared to Malays and Indians. While rates in Chinese men, and, to a lesser extent, Chinese women, had been declining since the early 1980s, rates in Malay men continued to increase. The full APC model described the cancer trend in Chinese males, Chinese females and Malay males, while an age-drift model described the cancer trend in Malay females. Among Chinese males, Chinese females and Malay males, there was no clear pattern to the period curvature effects, although similar cohort curvatures were seen, with positive curvature effects in older cohorts that declined towards zero and negative effects in younger cohorts. Conclusion: There are strong gender and ethnic differences in lung cancer incidence in Singapore. Differences in smoking rates and differential ethnic effects of smoking may explain some but not all of these differences. The similar cohort curvatures suggest that environmental factors in Singapore occurring in the past but no longer present at similar intensity or frequency may explain the positive deviation from a linear trend. Apart from smoking, other environmental factors such as changes in diet, improved sanitation and ventilation, and declines in infectious diseases like tuberculosis may play a role. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","['Lim, W.-Y.', 'Tan, C.S.', 'Loy, E.Y.', 'Omkar Prasad, R.', 'Seow, A.', 'Chia, K.S.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2014.01.007
Employment status and work-related difficulties in lung cancer survivors compared with the general population,"OBJECTIVE:: To investigate the employment status of lung cancer survivors and the work-related problems they face. BACKGROUND:: Although the number of lung cancer survivors is increasing, little is known about their employment and work-related issues. METHODS:: We enrolled 830 lung cancer survivors 12 months after lung cancer curative surgery (median time after diagnosis, 4.11 years) and 1000 volunteers from the general population. All participants completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire, Core 30-item and a questionnaire that included items relating to their jobs. We used logistic regression analysis to identify independent predictors of unemployment. RESULTS:: The employment rate of lung cancer survivors decreased from 68.6% at the time of diagnosis to 38.8% after treatment, which was significantly lower than the employment rate of the general population (63.5%; adjusted odds ratio = 2.31, 95% confidence interval: 1.66-3.22). The posttreatment unemployment rate was higher for women than for men. Among survivors, employment was inversely associated with older age, household income, number of comorbidities, and poor social functioning. Fatigue (78.6%) was the most common work-related problem reported by survivors. CONCLUSIONS:: Lung cancer survivors experienced more difficulties in employment than did the general population. Age, monthly household income, number of comorbidities, and social functioning appear to be important factors influencing employment status. These findings suggest that lung cancer survivors need support to cope with the financial impact of cancer. © 2013 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.","['Kim, Y.A.', 'Yun, Y.H.', 'Chang, Y.J.', 'Lee, J.', 'Kim, M.S.', 'Lee, H.-S.', 'Zo, J.I.', 'Kim, J.', 'Choi, Y.S.', 'Shim, Y.M.', 'Yoon, S.-J.']",10.1097/SLA.0b013e318291db9d
Symptom burden and comorbidities impact the consistency of responses on patient-reported functional outcomes,"Objective: To assess the influence of symptom intensity, mood, and comorbidities on patient-clinician agreement and the consistency of responses to functional patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Design: Two data sources were used. The first, a cross-sectional database of patients with breast cancer who completed functional PROs and were administered the FIM, was used to examine whether average pain intensity (as measured with an 11-point numeric rating scale [NRS]) and Rand Mental Health inventory scores differed among those rating their functional independence as different than clinicians. The second, a longitudinal database of 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer who completed the Activity Measure for Post Acute Care Computer Adaptive Test (AM PAC CAT) with differences between their expected and actual responses as reflected in their AM PAC CAT SEs. Setting: Two tertiary medical centers. Participants: Data source #1, 163 women with stage IV breast cancer; data source #2, 311 adults with late-stage lung cancer. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Data source #1, FIM, pain NRS, Older Americans Resource Study activities of daily living subscale, Physical Function-10, Mental Health Inventory-17. Data source #2, AM PAC CAT and NRS symptom ratings. Results: Pain intensity was significantly higher when clinicians and patients disagreed regarding a patient's independence in the ability to transfer (NRS pain severity, 3.78 vs 2.40; P=.014), groom (3.71 vs 2.36, P=.009), bathe (3.76 vs 2.40, P=.016), and dress (3.09 vs 2.44, P=.034). The magnitude of AM PAC CAT SEs was significantly associated with the severity of participants' pain, dyspnea, and fatigue, as well as the presence of musculoskeletal disorders and coronary artery disease. Neither mood nor emotional distress was associated with clinician-patient agreement or AM PAC CAT SE. Conclusions: Pain intensity is associated with disagreement between patients and clinicians about the patient's level of functioning. Moreover, physical symptoms (pain, dyspnea, fatigue) as well as specific medical comorbidities (musculoskeletal disorders, coronary artery disease), but not mood, are associated with inconsistency in patients' assessment of their functional abilities. © 2014 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.","['Cheville, A.L.', 'Basford, J.R.', 'Dos Santos, K.', 'Kroenke, K.']",10.1016/j.apmr.2013.08.009
Elimination of socioeconomic and racial disparities related to lung cancer: Closing the gap at a high volume community cancer center,"Background Healthcare disparities have afflicted the healthcare industry for decades and there have been many campaigns in recent years to identify and eliminate disparities. The purpose of this study was to identify disparities in the lung cancer population of a single community cancer center and to report the results in accordance with industry goals. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of data on non-small cell lung cancer patients recorded in the Christiana Care Tumor Registry (CCTR) in Delaware. Gender, age, race, socioeconomic status and insurance status were used as potential variables in identifying disparities. Results We found no significant disparities between sexes, race or patients who were classified as having socioeconomic status 1-3. There was a lower survival rate associated with having the poorest socioeconomic status and in patients who used Medicare. Uninsured patients had the best survival outcomes and patients with Medicare had the poorest survival outcomes. Conclusion Although we have closed the gap on sex and racial disparities, there remains a difference in survival outcomes across socioeconomic classes and insurance types. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Sex differences in early outcomes after lung cancer resection: Analysis of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons General Thoracic Database,"Objectives Women with lung cancer have superior long-term survival outcomes compared with men, independent of stage. The cause of this disparity is unknown. For patients undergoing lung cancer resection, these survival differences could be due, in part, to relatively better perioperative outcomes for women. This study was undertaken to determine differences in perioperative outcomes after lung cancer surgery on the basis of sex. Methods The Society of Thoracic Surgeons' General Thoracic Database was queried for all patients undergoing resection of lung cancer between 2002 and 2010. Postoperative complications were analyzed with respect to sex. Univariable analysis was performed, followed by multivariable modeling to determine significant risk factors for postoperative morbidity and mortality. Results A total of 34,188 patients (16,643 men and 17,545 women) were considered. Univariable analysis demonstrated statistically significant differences in postoperative complications favoring women in all categories of postoperative complications. Women also had lower in-hospital and 30-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.71; P <.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that several preoperative conditions independently predicted 30-day mortality: male sex, increasing age, lower diffusion capacity, renal insufficiency, preoperative radiation therapy, cancer stage, extent of resection, and thoracotomy as surgical approach. Coronary artery disease was an independent predictor of mortality in women but not in men. Thoracotomy as the surgical approach and preoperative radiation therapy were predictive of mortality for men but not for women. Postoperative prolonged air leak and empyema predicted mortality in men but not in women. Conclusions Women have lower postoperative morbidity and mortality after lung cancer surgery. Some risk factors are sex-specific with regard to mortality. Further study is warranted to determine the cause of these differences and to determine their effect on survival. © 2014 by The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.","['Tong, B.C.', 'Kosinski, A.S.', 'Burfeind Jr., W.R.', 'Onaitis, M.W.', 'Berry, M.F.', 'Harpole Jr., D.H.', ""D'Amico, T.A.""]",10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.03.012
The use of pharmacogenomics for selection of therapy in Non-Small-Cell lung cancer,"Introduction: Performance status (PS) is the only known clinical predictor of outcome in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although pharmacogenomic markers may also correlate with outcome. The aim of our study was to correlate clinical and pharmacogenomic measures with overall survival. Methods: This was an IRB approved, retrospective study in which the medical records of 50 patients with advanced NSCLC from 1998–2008 were reviewed, and gender, race, PS, and chemotherapy regimens were documented. Stromal expression of pharmacogenomic markers (VEGFR, ERCC1, 14-3-3σ, pAKT, and PTEN) was measured. Clinical factors and pharmacogenomics markers were compared to overall survival using a Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Forty patients received platinum-based therapy. Median age was 65 years. Improved PS, female gender, and gemcitabine therapy were signifi-cantly associated with longer overall survival (P = 0.004, P = 0.04, and P = 0.003, respectively). Age was not associated with survival. Caucasians had better overall survival in comparison to African Americans with median survival of 14.8 months versus 10.4 months (P = 0.1). Patients treated with platinum-based therapy had better survival of 15 months versus 8 months for non-platinum based therapy (P = 0.01). There was no significant association between any of the pharmacogenomics markers and overall survival other than in patients treated with platinum, in whom ERCC1 negativity was strongly associated with longer survival (P = 0.007). Conclusion: ERCC1 negativity with platinum therapy, gemcitabine therapy, good PS, and female gender all correlated with improved overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC.","['Karim, N.A.', 'Bui, H.', 'Pathrose, P.', 'Starnes, S.', 'Patil, N.', 'Shehata, M.', 'Mostafa, A.', 'Rao, M.B.', 'Zarzour, A.', 'Anderson, M.']",10.4137/CMO.S18369
Clinical-epidemiological study on the incidence of postoperative complications after pulmonary resection for lung cancer,"AIM: To determine the relationship between the characteristics of a group of lung cancer patients, lung cancer surgeries, and the incidence of early and/or late postoperative complications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included a group of 115 lung cancer patients aged 40 to 85 years, 76.5% men, 60.91% living in urban areas, who received surgical treatment in the interval January 2013-August 2014. Data were collected from electronic medical records and survey sheets and processed and interpreted using Pearson correlation index (p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant and of <0.005 highly statistically significant), and chi2, y, 1c = 25% tests. All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical software package version 13.0. RESULTS: Of the 115 patients 7.8% were in the 40-50 years age group and 87.8% in the 51-75 years age group (p < or = 0.001). Most patients were males (76.5%, p < 0.001), and 60.9% of the patients were living in urban areas (p < or = 0.05). The difference in the prevalence of smokers (76.5%) vs. non smokers (23.5%) was highly statistically significant (p < 0.005). Active smoking of one pack of cigarettes per day for more than 10 years was recorded in 54.8%. The presence of co morbidities (17 events) and the distribution of neoplastic lesions in the five anatomical areas required the performance of lobectomies, bilobectomies or pneumectomies. The incidence of early (14 entities) and late postoperative complications (7 entities) depended on patient's general condition, nature of co morbidities, location and stage of neoplastic lesions, and surgical complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer, in various locations and stages, most commonly affected males aged 40-85 years, from urban areas, smokers, with various co morbidities. Surgeries performed in these patients were often laborious and with a relatively low incidence of postoperative complications.","['Bosînceanu, M.', 'Sandu, C.', 'Ionescu, L.R.', 'Roată, C.', 'Miron, L.']",
Stage-adjusted lung cancer survival does not differ between low-income blacks and whites,"Introduction: Few lung cancer studies have focused on lung cancer survival in underserved populations. We conducted a prospective cohort study among 81,697 racially diverse and medically underserved adults enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study throughout an 11-state area of the Southeast from March 2002 to September 2009. Methods: Using linkages with state cancer registries, we identified 501 incident non-small-cell lung cancer cases. We applied Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for subsequent mortality among black and white participants. Results: The mean observed follow-up time (the time from diagnosis to death or end of follow-up) was 1.25 years (range, 0-8.3 years) and 75% (n = 376) of cases died during follow-up. More blacks were diagnosed at distant stage than whites (57 versus 45%; p = 0.03). In multivariable analyses adjusted for pack-years of smoking, age, body mass index, health insurance, socioeconomic status and disease stage, the lung cancer mortality HR was higher for men versus women (HR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.81) but similar for blacks versus whites (HR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.74-1.32). Conclusion: These findings suggest that although proportionally more blacks present with distant-stage disease there is no difference in stage-adjusted lung cancer mortality between blacks and whites of similar low socioeconomic status.

"Chronic disease mortality in rural and urban residents in Hubei Province, China, 2008-2010.","Chronic non-communicable diseases have become the major cause of death in China. This study describes and compares chronic disease mortality between urban and rural residents in Hubei Province, central China. Death records of all individuals aged 15 years and over who died from 2008 through 2010 in Hubei were obtained from the Disease Surveillance Points system maintained by the Hubei Province Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Average annual mortality, standardized death rates, years of potential life lost (YLL), average years of potential life lost (AYLL) and rates of life lost were calculated for urban and rural residents. Standardized rate ratios (SRR) were calculated to compare the death rates between urban and rural areas. A total of 86.2% of deaths were attributed to chronic non-communicable diseases in Hubei. Cerebrovascular diseases, ischemic heart disease and neoplasms were the main leading causes in both urban and rural areas, and the mortality rates were higher among rural residents. Lung cancer was the principal cause of mortality from cancer among urban and rural residents, and stomach cancer and liver cancer were more common in rural than urban areas. Breast cancer mortality among women in rural areas was lower than in urban areas (SRR=0.73, 95% CI=0.63-0.85). The standardized mortality for chronic lower respiratory disease among men in rural areas was higher than in urban areas (SRR=4.05, 95% CI=3.82-4.29). Among men, total AYLL from liver cancer and other diseases of liver were remarkably higher than other causes in urban and rural areas. Among women the highest AYLL were due to breast cancer in both urban and rural areas. Chronic diseases were the major cause of death in Hubei Province. While circulatory system diseases were the leading causes in both urban and rural areas, our study highlights that attention should also be paid to breast cancer among women and chronic lower respiratory disease among rural residents. It is important that governments focus on this public health issue and develop preventive strategies to reduce morbidity and premature mortality from chronic non-communicable diseases.","['Cheng, L.', 'Tan, L.', 'Zhang, L.', 'Wei, S.', 'Liu, L.', 'Long, L.', 'Zhang, J.', 'Wu, Y.', 'Zhang, Q.', 'Nie, S.']",
"Effectiveness and response predictive factors of erlotinib in a non-small cell lung cancer unselected European population previously treated: A retrospective, observational, multicentric study","Aims and background: Erlotinib approval was supported by the positive results of a large multicentric phase III trial(BR.21 study) that included 10% Asiatic patients and the remaining were North-American Caucasian. It is well-knownthat the efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is strongly influenced by ethnicity and other genetic factors. It is, therefore,relevant to establish whether the same profile of efficacy is seen in an unselected population and whether the results ofBR.21 can be generalized to other patient populations, such as that described here.Methods: In this retrospective, observational, multicentric study, we assessed effectiveness and potentially responsepredictive factors in 222 unselected Italian patients, with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer, with performance statusfrom 0 to 3, who had received at least one line of chemotherapy, treated with the standard dose of erlotinib (150 mgonce daily) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.Results: The disease control rate was 60.9% (135 patients). Median progression-free survival and overall survival timeswere 3.1 months and 7.97 months, respectively. The characteristics of non-smoker, female gender, performance status 0or 1 were associated with a significantly better prognosis in terms of disease control rate and were also predictive oflonger overall survival and progression-free survival. The 1-year survival rate was 38.79%. Even though Italian patientsbaseline characteristics were strongly different to those reported in pivotal BR.21 trial in terms of age, performancestatus, line treatment and ethnic group, our study confirms the favorable effectiveness profile in real clinical practice oferlotinib according to results from the pivotal study BR.21.Conclusions: Today, we know that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status assessment is mandatory beforestarting first-line therapy and that the presence of only certain clinical characteristics initially associated with sensitivity toEGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as reported in this study, is not sufficient in selecting patients candidates to suchtreatments. © 2012 The Author(s).","['Cioffi, P.', 'Marotta, V.', 'Fanizza, C.', 'Giglioni, A.', 'Natoli, C.', 'Petrelli, F.', 'Grappasonni, I.']",10.1177/1078155212465994
Patterns of care in palliative radiotherapy: A population-based study,"Purpose: Approximately one half of the radiotherapy (RT) prescribed in the United States is delivered with palliative intent. The purpose of this study was to investigate the patterns of delivery of palliative RT across the United States. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked database, 51,610 patients were identified with incident stage IV breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 and observed through 2009. Multivariate logistic regression determined predictors of palliative RT. Results: Forty-one percent of the study population received palliative RT, including 53% of patients with lung cancer, followed by those with breast (42%), prostate (40%), and colorectal cancers (12%). Multivariate analysis revealed that older patients (P < .001) and those with higher Charlson comorbidity scores (P < .001) were less likely to receive palliative RT. Black patients with prostate cancer were 20% less likely (P < .001), and black patients with colorectal cancer were 28% less likely (P < .001), than white patients to receive palliative RT. Among those treated with RT, 23% of patients with lung cancer died within 2 weeks of completing treatment, followed by those with colorectal (12%), breast (11%), and prostate cancers (8%). In addition to tumor site, significant predictors (P < .05) of death within 2 weeks of receiving RT included increased age, increased comorbidity, and male sex. Conclusion: Inequality in the receipt of palliative RT exists among the elderly and patients with comorbid conditions and varies with race. In addition, a significant number of patients die shortly after receiving RT. Understanding these patterns of care, along with further research into the underlying causes, will improve access and quality of palliative RT.

"Treatment decisions and discontinuation of palliative chemotherapy near the end-of-life, in relation to socioeconomic variables","During the last decades, the possibilities to prolong survival with chemotherapy even in metastatic disease have increased. Our aim was to study treatment decisions and treatment discontinuation decisions in the proximity of death. Methods. The medical records of 346 patients with disseminated cancer and a recorded death during 2009 were assessed in relation to demographic and clinical variables and documented treatment decisions were recorded. Results. Palliative chemotherapy was offered in 54% or these cases and generally one or two regimens were administered, before ending treatment. During the last month of life, 32% received treatment and much more often as an oral (instead of intravenous) treatment than in earlier stages (p < 0.001). Younger patients (p = 0.02) and those with young children (p < 0.001) were treated to a higher degree and also closer to death (p = 0.03). Other variables associated with a higher probability of treatment were high education level (p = 0.001), living with a partner (p = 0.001), female gender (p = 0.023) and ethnicity of non-European origin (p = 0.031). In a multivariate analysis, young age and high education remained as independent factors. In 57% of the cases there was no formal documentation of treatment discontinuation or end-of-life discussions with the patient. Conclusion. Socioeconomic status (SES) is of importance for the treatment decisions. About half of the patients with disseminated disease receive palliative chemotherapy and of these, about one third are treated even during the last month of life. In a majority of cases, there is no formal documentation of treatment discontinuation or end-of-life discussions. © 2013 Informa Healthcare.","['Randén, M.', 'Helde-Frankling, M.', 'Runesdotter, S.', 'Strang, P.']",10.3109/0284186X.2012.758872
"Diverging socioeconomic inequality in life expectancy of Francophones and Anglophones in Montréal, Québec: Tobacco to blame?","Aim: We evaluated the ages and causes of death contributing to life expectancy gaps between economically advantaged and disadvantaged Francophones and Anglophones of Montréal, a Canadian metropolitan centre. Subject and Methods: We partitioned the life expectancy gap at birth between socioeconomically disadvantaged and advantaged Francophones and Anglophones of Montréal (Québec) into age and cause of death components for two periods (1989-1993, 2002-2006). Changes in the contributions of causes over time were evaluated. Results: Life expectancy was lower for disadvantaged Francophones and Anglophones by 5 years in men and 1.6 years in women compared with advantaged individuals. Over time, the socioeconomic gap widened for Francophones (men 0.3 years, women 2.8 years), due to smaller reductions in mortality from tobacco-related causes (cardiovascular, cancer, respiratory) in disadvantaged than in advantaged Francophones, especially after age ≥65 years (except lung cancer mortality that increased, particularly in disadvantaged women). The socioeconomic gap narrowed, however, for Anglophones (men 1.0 year, women 0.6 years), due to greater reductions in cardiovascular mortality in disadvantaged than advantaged Anglophones. Conclusion: Socioeconomic inequalities in life expectancy decreased for Anglophones but increased for Francophones in Montréal due to underlying trends in tobacco-related mortality. Despite strong tobacco control laws in Canada, socioeconomic inequality in tobacco-related mortality is widening for Francophones in Montréal. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","['Auger, N.', 'Harper, S.', 'Barry, A.D.']",10.1007/s10389-013-0559-6
Clinical characteristics of 274 non-small cell lung cancer patients in China,"Background: The mortality from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China is increasing, and studies about clinical characteristics of recent NSCLC are rare. The primary objective of this study was to explore clinical features in a large general hospital in Northwest China, and to determine risk factors for stage, pathology and survival, with a view to prevention and treatment of NSCLC as well as establishment and improvement of national medical insurance policies. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of NSCLC patients (n = 274), as well as risk factors for advanced stage and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Survival features in different groups were analyzed, as well as risk factors of survival. Follow-up was at least 3 years. Results: 179 were male (65.3%); 136 had adenocarcinoma (49.6%) and 109 had SCC (39.8%); 186 (67.9%) had advanced-stage disease (IIIB-IV); 130 (47.4%) had smoking habits; 195 came from an urban area (71.2%); 69 had local urban resident basic medical insurance; 58% were younger than 60 years. Female, adenocarcinoma, rural patients were significantly younger than male, SCC, and urban patients. Pathology was the only independent risk factor for advanced stage. Age, sex, and smoking status were independent prognostic factors for SCC. The proportion of male SCC was higher than female SCC even without the influence of smoking. Without local urban resident basic medical insurance, higher stage and not having surgery, but not smoking status, were independent risk factors for lower median progression-free survival (PFS). Patients with adenocarcinoma and SCC in advanced stage accepting EGFR-TKI during treatment had a higher 1-year survival rate and longer overall survival (OS) compared with those never accepting EGFR-TKI. EGFR-TKI treatment and chemotherapy regimen numbers were independent risk factor for median OS in advanced adenocarcinoma and SCC patients. Conclusion: More prevention and screening should be carried out for the female and rural population. EGFR-TKI could benefit advanced NSCLCs. China's medical insurance policy has some adverse effect on NSCLC survival calling for further improvement. Copyright © 2013 S.

Reasons for delay in diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer among patients in Lublin Voivodeship who were consulted in Thoracic surgery department,"Introduction: Despite the progress which has been made in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, it is still one of the main causes of death in both men and women. The introduction of new therapeutic modalities did not improve the 5-year survival results of lung cancer patients. The Lublin Voivodeship is a sparsely-inhabited area with little urbanization and a population of about 2.2 million people. Only 46.8% of its citizens live in the towns, while the national average is 61.9%. Objectives: The aim of the study was to compare the differences in the periods of time and reasons for delay in diagnosis and initiation of treatment of lung cancer among patients who are inhabitants of the rural and urban regions of Lublin Voivodeship, and who were consulted in Thoracic Surgery Department. Materials and methods: 300 lung cancer patients who were consulted in the Thoracic Surgery Outpatient Clinic or who were hospitalized in the Department of Thoracic Surgery in the period between 2 January 2010 - 7 January 2011 were included in the study. Delays were calculated for two periods of time: 1) time from the first signs of the disease to the first medical examination; 2) the time from the first visit to a doctor to the start of treatment, or disqualification from the causative treatment. The time of the first delay for the urban and rural populations was similar and ranged from 2-37 weeks and 2-23 weeks, respectively. Lack of time and disregard of signs of disease were the most commonly reasons given for the first delay among rural residents. The urban population indicated fear and lack of time as the main reasons of delay. Assessment of the second reason for delay was possible thanks to a specially designed research protocol which gathered the main reasons of delay in several subgroups that enabled their statistical evaluation. The length of second period was similar for both populations. Results: There were no significant differences in the length of the time of delay between the two assessed groups. In both groups, delays dependent on poor healthcare access were similar. Among rural inhabitants, the most often reasons of delay were waiting for hospital admission and re-bronchoscopy. In the urban population, the most common reasons for delay were waiting for hospitalization and CT procedure. Conclusions: The results of the presented research allowed the following conclusions to be drawn: between the two assessed groups there were no differences in the length of the time of delay; 2) delays in diagnosis and treatment were too long for the patients and could affect the severity of the disease and final prognosis; 3) there is a need for intensification of information campaigns on lung cancer in order to reduce the delays dependent on patients, and to improve the cooperation of family doctors, pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons and oncologists.","['Sawicki, M.', 'Szczyrek, M.', 'Krawczyk, P.', 'Rybojad, P.', 'Jabłonka, A.', 'Milanowski, J.']",

Incidence of non-small-cell lung cancer among California hispanics according to neighborhood socioeconomic status,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer incidence is associated with markers of lower socioeconomic status (SES) in whites, blacks, and Asians but with markers of higher SES in Hispanics. The magnitude and etiology of this positive gradient in Hispanics remain undefined. We examined non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) incidence and ever-smoking rates among California Hispanics according to measures of SES. METHODS: We computed neighborhood (n)SES-specific incidence rates by sex and race or ethnicity for 74,179 NSCLC cases in the California Cancer Registry, 1998-2002. Associations between nSES and NSCLC incidence were examined, using incidence rate ratios and linear trend tests, and stratified by age, stage, and histology. Ever-smoking rates among Hispanics were obtained from California Health Interview Survey 2001 data, and odds ratios for ever-smoking were calculated for measures of SES and acculturation. RESULTS: Compared with the lowest nSES quintile, the NSCLC incidence in the highest quintile was 1.86 and 1.18 times higher for Hispanic women and men, respectively. The positive nSES gradients remained significant for all ages, stages, and nonsquamous histologies in women, and only for older age, local or regional stages, and adenocarcinoma histology in men. Ever-smoking rates were associated with English-speaking households and U.S.-born status for Hispanic women and low education and U.S.-born status for Hispanic men. CONCLUSIONS: For California Hispanics, higher nSES was strongly associated with increased NSCLC incidence in women, but weakly associated in men, and ever-smoking rates were strongly correlated with increased acculturation. This finding may portend an increasing burden of NSCLC in Hispanic women, given future trends in acculturation and SES.

"Survival analysis in advanced non small cell lung cancer treated with platinum based chemotherapy in combination with paclitaxel, gemcitabine and etoposide","Background: The wide spectrum of clinical features in advanced stages of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) probably contributes to disparities in outcomes because of different prognostic variables significant for stage IIIB/IV patients. Hence the aim of this study was to check for favorable response of patients to various chemotherapeutic combinations with respect to patient survival in stage IIIB and stage IV NSCLC disease. We selected those patients for our study who were receiving treatment with paclitaxel, gemcitabine or etoposide in combination with platinum based drugs. Materials and Methods: Seventy-two patients who visited the hospital from June 2009 to November 2012 with confirmed diagnosis of lung cancer were included, and data were collected for follow up and classified according to treatment received with respect to patients' regimen and response, and overall survival. This study analyzed tumor variables that were associated with clinical outcome in advanced NSCLC patients who were undergoing first-line chemotherapy for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Results: Comparative data on various parameters like age, gender, stage, histology, site of disease, metastatic site and chemo-regimens was analyzed; these parameters predicted variable significant improvement for overall survival (p=0.05). One and two year survival rates were 20.8% and 15.3% . Conclusions: In this study we found slight improvement in survival rates in NSCLC and clinical outcomes with one combination (carboplatin+paclitaxel). Overall there were only marginal differences in survival rates for other chemo-regimens evaluated in this study.","['Natukula, K.', 'Jamil, K.', 'Pingali, U.R.', 'Suresh Attili, V.S.', 'Naidu Madireddy, U.R.']",10.7314/APJCP.2013.14.8.4661
Effect of chemotherapy on the quality of life of lung cancer patients,"Background and objective With development of modern medicine, eliminating patients' pain and mental disorder and improving the quality of life has become an important problem in patients with cancer. The aim of this study is to observe the impact of chemotherapy on quality of life and influencing factor of quality of life among lung cancer patients. Methods Sixty-one lung cancer patients were assessed with clinical outcomes and the EORTC QLQ;C30 questionnaires before chemotherapy, one week after 2 cycles of chemotherapy, one week after 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Results After 2 cycles of chemotherapy, effective rate was 40.0%. Social function decreased. Nause and vomiting, insomnia and appetite loss deteriorated (P<0.05). After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, effective rate was 23%. But after chemotherapy, physical, role, emotional, social function decreased; Appetite loss, nausea and vomiting, insomnia deteriorated, economics became difficult to some patients (P<0.05). In our study, we find female patients had more fatigue and appetite loss than male patients (P<0.05). Patients of low level of education had more fatigue and insomnia than patients of high level of education (P<0.05). Elder patients had more fatigue, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting than middle-aged patients (P<0.05). Grouped according to body mass index, the difference wasn't statistically significant (P>0.05). Grouped according to the plasma albumin level, the difference wasn't statistically significant (P>0.05). In hypoproteinemia group, symptoms and economic difficulties score was higher; High protein group, function and general health scores was higher. Conclusion After the chemotherapy, patients' the lesion of cancer became smaller and clinical symptoms relieved, but some patients, fatigue, appetite loss, nausea and vomiting symptom deteriorated, emotion became bad. Quality of life of lung cancer patients decrease. We should pay more attention to the adverse reactions of chemotherapy and cope with them, give positive psychological intervention and improve patients, nutrition to improve the quality of life.","['Liu, X.', 'Wang, Y.', 'Li, S.', 'Xin, S.', 'Cao, J.']",10.3779/j.issn.l009-3419.2013.12.07
"Patient factors, health care factors and survival from lung cancer according to ethnic group in the south of London, UK","UK International and UK data suggest that there are ethnic differences in survival for some malignancies. The aim of the present study was to identify any health inequalities related to lung cancer and ethnicity. Data on 423 patients with a diagnosis of lung cancer treated at a large specialist cancer hospital in London UK were analysed. Data on stage of disease at diagnosis, co-morbidities, socio-economic status, treatments received and survival were collected and examined for differences by ethnic group. There was a significant difference between black and minority ethnic (BME) patients and White-European patients in socio-economic status (Chi-square test P-value < 0.001). BME patients were over-represented in the most deprived socio-economic groups and under-represented in the most affluent. There were no significant differences in histology, stage of disease, co-morbidities and performance status or treatments received between the different ethnic groups. Ethnicity was not associated with survival. Significant prognostic factors for overall survival were performance status (P < 0.001), stage of disease (P= 0.001) and gender (P= 0.003). Our findings suggest that patients from BME groups are over-represented in more deprived socio-economic groups; however, this did not impact on significant prognostic factors or the treatments that they received.

Diverging trends in educational inequalities in cancer mortality between men and women in the 2000s in France.,"Socioeconomic inequalities in cancer mortality have been observed in different European countries and the US until the end of the 1990s, with changes over time in the magnitude of these inequalities and contrasted situations between countries. The aim of this study is to estimate relative and absolute educational differences in cancer mortality in France between 1999 and 2007, and to compare these inequalities with those reported during the 1990s. Data from a representative sample including 1% of the French population were analysed. Educational differences among people aged 30-74 were quantified with hazard ratios and relative indices of inequality (RII) computed using Cox regression models as well as mortality rate difference and population attributable fraction. In the period 1999-2007, large relative inequalities were found among men for total cancer and smoking and/or alcohol related cancers mortality (lung, head and neck, oesophagus). Among women, educational differences were reported for total cancer, head and neck and uterus cancer mortality. No association was found between education and breast cancer mortality. Slight educational differences in colorectal cancer mortality were observed in men and women. For most frequent cancers, no change was observed in the magnitude of relative inequalities in mortality between the 1990s and the 2000s, although the RII for lung cancer increased both in men and women. Among women, a large increase in absolute inequalities in mortality was observed for all cancers combined, lung, head and neck and colorectal cancer. In contrast, among men, absolute inequalities in mortality decreased for all smoking and/or alcohol related cancers. Although social inequalities in cancer mortality are still high among men, an encouraging trend is observed. Among women though, the situation regarding social inequalities is less favourable, mainly due to a health improvement limited to higher educated women. These inequalities may be expected to further increase in future years.","['Menvielle, G.', 'Rey, G.', 'Jougla, E.', 'Luce, D.']",
"Household income, sex and respiratory mortality in São Paulo, Brazil, 1996-2010","SETTING: Respiratory mortality rates are declining in several countries, including Brazil; however, the effect of socio-economic indicators and sex is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To identify differences in mortality trends according to income and sex in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. DESIGN: We performed a time-trend analysis of all respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer and tuberculosis, using Joinpoint regression comparing high, middle and low household income levels from 1996 to 2010. RESULTS: The annual per cent change (APC) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) for death rates from all respiratory disease in men in high-income areas was -1.1 (95%CI -2.7 to 0.5) in 1996-2002 and -4.3 (95%CI -5.9 to -2.8) in 2003-2009. In middle- and low-income areas, the decline was respectively -1.5 (95%CI -2.2 to -0.7) and -1.4 (95%CI -1.9 to -0.8). For women, the APC declined in high-income (-1.0, 95%CI -1.9 to -0.2) and low-income areas (0.8, 95%CI -1.3 to -0.2), but not in middle-income areas (-0.5, 95%CI -1.4 to 0.3) from 1996 to 2010.

Methods: The study is based on the linkage between all records of the 2001 population census and all records from Lithuanian Cancer Registry (cancer incidence) and Statistics Lithuania (deaths) for the period between 1 July 2001 and 31 December 2004. Education-specific incidence and mortality rate ratios were estimated by means of multivariate Poisson regression models. Results: We found both the positive and inverse educational gradients in cancer incidence and mortality. The risk of developing cancer (all sites) was lower among men and women with the lowest education, whereas cancer mortality was higher among lower educated men. The higher educational level was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer among men and an increased risk of breast cancer among women. However, prostate cancer mortality was the highest in the lowest education group, whereas breast cancer mortality among women did not show any statistically significant differences. Lower educated men had significantly higher incidence and mortality due to lung and stomach cancers. Strikingly high incidence and mortality due to cervix cancer was observed among women with secondary and lower than secondary education. Conclusion: The results point to inequalities in early diagnosis and survival from cancer and failures ensuring equal access to medical care. Further more in-depth studies are needed in order to understand the nature and determinants of these inequalities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","['Smailyte, G.', 'Jasilionis, D.', 'Ambrozaitiene, D.', 'Stankuniene, V.']",10.1016/j.canep.2012.05.009
T1/T2 non-small-cell lung cancer treated by lobectomy: Does tumor anatomic location matter?,"Background: The effect of tumor location on long-term survival after lobectomy for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer is unclear. Current data are limited to a retrospective single-institution series. We sought to determine if tumor anatomic location (i.e., the particular lobe that was involved) confers a survival advantage based on population-based data. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (1988-2007), we identified patients who underwent lobectomy for pathologic T1/T2 adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinomas. Wedge resections, segmentectomies, and pneumonectomies were excluded. We evaluated the association between the particular lobe that was involved, lymph node (LN) yield, and survival using the Kaplan-Meier method. To adjust for potential confounders, we used a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results: We identified 13,650 patients who met our inclusion criteria. There were significant differences in unadjusted overall (P = 0.03) and cancer-specific survivals (P = 0.03) based on tumor location. However, after adjusting for patient factors, geographic location of treatment, and tumor characteristics, we found that tumor location was not associated with significant differences in survival. We found that male gender, black race, squamous cell histology, increasing grade, and age were independent negative predictors of survival. Higher LN yields were independently associated with improved survival. Although adjusted survival rates were not significantly different, there were significant differences (P < 0.0001) in LN yield based on tumor location; right middle lobe had the lowest yield (5.1 nodes), and left upper lobe had the highest yield (eight nodes). Conclusions: LN counts are independent predictors of survival. Although it is associated with significant difference in LN yield, tumor location is not an independent predictor of survival. Age, race, gender, tumor size, histology, and grade appear to be more important prognostic factors. These data suggest that treatment of T1/T2 non-small-cell lung cancer should be dictated by the same oncologic principles, regardless of tumor location. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Outcomes of Malaysian patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and unknown epidermal growth factor receptor mutation status treated with gefitinib,"Aims: To evaluate the response and progression-free survival (PFS) of Malaysian patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and unknown epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status treated with gefitinib. Methods: A retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with EGFR mutation unknown stage III or IV lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutation unknown treated with gefitinib until disease progression. Results: Of 71 patients, none had complete response while 26 (36.6%) had partial response and 26 (36.6%) had stable disease. Multivariate analysis showed the independent predictor of response to gefitinib was Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 1 (odds ratio [OR] 5.39, 95% confidence interval [CI 1.64-17.74]P=0.006). The median PFS was 6.5months and was significantly longer in female than male patients (39.0 vs 21.2weeks; P<0.001), never smokers vs smokers (32.3 vs 8.3weeks, P=0.001), and stage III versus stage IV disease (44 vs 24weeks, P=0.021). In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model with age group, gender, ethnicity, smoking history, disease stage, ECOG performance status and prior cytotoxic chemotherapy as covariates, the independent predictors of longer median PFS were female gender (HR 95% CI 0.38 [0.22-0.66]; P<0.001) and stage III disease (HR 95% CI 0.54 [0.30-0.98], P=0.042).

Recent trends in resection rates among non-small cell lung cancer patients in England,"Background: Lung cancer resection rates are low in England, but reports have indicated an increase in recent years. We analysed the recent trends in surgical resection by age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation and surgical procedure in England. Methods: Data on 286 217 patients with non-small cell lung cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2008 were extracted from the English Cancer Repository Dataset and information on surgical resection for these patients was retrieved from linked Hospital Episode Statistics records. We calculated the OR of undergoing surgery per 1-year increment by age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation and surgical procedure. A multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the association between age and type of surgery. Results: The proportion of patients with non-small cell lung cancer undergoing surgery increased from 8.8% in 1998 to 10.6% in 2008. The increase was similar between levels of socioeconomic deprivation, slightly more pronounced among women (OR=1.023 per 1-year calendar increment, 95% CI 1.016 to 1.029) than men (OR=1.010, 95% CI 1.005 to 1.015) and most prominent with increasing age (75-79 age group: OR 1.051, 95% CI 1.041 to 1.062; 80-84 age group: OR 1.102, 95% CI 1.080 to 1.124; and 85+ age group: OR 1.130, 95% CI 1.069 to 1.193). Increasing age was associated with a decreased likelihood of undergoing pneumonectomy (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.89 per 5-year age increment) or sleeve resection (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.79) compared with lobectomy, and a slightly increased likelihood of undergoing a wedge resection (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.10).

An ecological approach to examine lung cancer disparities due to sexual orientation,"Objectives: To determine whether there is an association between geographical areas with greater sexual minority density, defined as gay and lesbian individuals, and incidence and mortality rates for lung cancer. Study design: As individual surveillance data on sexual orientation are not available, this study used an ecological approach to examine the link between sexual minorities and lung cancer. Methods: Population-based surveillance data on the incidence of and mortality due to lung cancer from 1996 to 2004 were used from 12 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registries and 2000 Census data on same-sex-partnered households for the geographical area covered by SEER 12. Using multiple regression models, the county-level association of sexual minority density with incidence or mortality rates for lung cancer was examined. Results: A significant positive association was found between both incidence and mortality rates for lung cancer and areas with a higher density of sexual minority men, and a significant negative association was found between both incidence and mortality rates for lung cancer and areas with a higher density of sexual minority women. Conclusions: In the absence of surveillance data, this novel methodological strategy approximates population-level lung cancer disparities for sexual minority populations at the aggregate level. © 2012 The Royal Society for Public Health.","['Boehmer, U.', 'Ozonoff, A.', 'Miao, X.']",10.1016/j.puhe.2012.04.004
Causal effect of education on mortality in a quasi-experiment on 1.2 million Swedes,"In 1949-1962, Sweden implemented a 1-y increase in compulsory schooling as a quasi-experiment. Each year, children in a number of municipalities were exposed to the reform and others were kept as controls, allowing us to test the hypothesis that education is causally related to mortality. We studied all children born between 1943 and 1955, in 900 Swedish municipalities, with control for birth-cohort and area differences. Primary outcome measures are all-cause and cause-specific mortality until the end of 2007. The analyses include 1,247,867 individuals, of whom 92,351 died. We found lower all-cause mortality risk in the experimental group after age 40 [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-0.99] but not before (HR = 1.03, 95% CI 0.98-1.07) or during the whole follow-up (HR = 0.98, 95% CI 0.95-1.01). After age 40, the experimental group had lower mortality from overall cancer, lung cancer, and accidents. In addition, exposed women had lower mortality from ischemic heart disease, and exposed men lower mortality from overall external causes. In analyses stratified for final educational level, we found lower mortality in the experimental group within the strata that settled for compulsory schooling only (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99) and compulsory schooling plus vocational training (HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97). Thus, the experimental group had lower mortality from causes known to be related to education. Lower mortality in the experimental group was also found among the least educated, a group that clearly benefited from the reform in terms of educational length. However, all estimates are small and there was no evident impact of the reform on all-cause mortality in all ages.","['Lager, A.C.J.', 'Torssander, J.']",10.1073/pnas.1105839109
Is lung cancer in women different?,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the world, favored by smoking. Nonsmall cell lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease whose prevalence is increasing among women. Epidemiological, hormonal and pathological factors explain tumor differences between men and women. Women have more frequently adenocarcinomas, EGFR mutations and respond better to cancer treatments. In recent decades, many advances have been made, allowing us to move from histological to molecular characterization of lung tumors. Further analysis of gender disparities will help us to understand and improve the management of patients with NSCLC.","['Ben Aissa, A.', 'Mach, N.']",
"Prognostic factors for survival in a Chinese population presenting with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with an emphasis on smoking status: A regional, single-institution, retrospective analysis of 4552 patients","Background: Lung cancer ranks as the top of cancer-related mortality in the world. Approximately 85-90% of all lung cancer cases are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For advanced NSCLC patients, the five-year survival rate is less than 5%. Previous studies have attempted to determine prognostic factors, such as smoking status, gender, ethnicity, age, and histological type. However, the results are controversial and conflict. In this study, we investigated prognostic factors in a Chinese population presenting with advanced NSCLC. Methods: Medical records of patients with advanced NSCLC (AJCC Stage IIIB/IV) who received treatment at our institution were reviewed.Kaplan-Meier method and Cox ProportionalHazards model were performed in both univariate andmultivariate analyses. Results: A total of 4552 patients were entered. Among them, 1320 (29.0%) were female, 2408 non-smokers (52.9%), and all had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) = 0/1. Univariate analysis suggested that female gender (P < 0.001), adenocarcinoma histology (P < 0.001), age <70 (P < 0.001), and non-smoker status (P < 0.001) were associated with better survival. However, multivariate analysis demonstrated that age (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.173, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.085-1.268, P < 0.001), smoking status (vs. nonsmokers, HR = 1.212, 95% CI: 1.123-1.308, P < 0.001), and histological type (nonadenocarcinoma vs. adenocarcinoma,HR = 1.104, 95% CI: 1.031-1.181, P = 0.004), but not gender,were independent prognostic factors. Conclusions: Smoking status, age, and histological type are independent prognostic factors in Chinese NSCLC patients presenting with advanced disease.

Risk of lung cancer by histology among immigrants to Sweden,"Background: We wanted to define lung cancer incidence rates by histological subtype among immigrants in Sweden to explore the effect of new environments on the incidence of lung cancer by histological subtype in different ethnic populations. Methods: The nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database w used to calculate age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) (per 100,000) and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). The patient series covered 19,255 male and 14,601 female Swedes, and 3236 male and 1751 female immigrants. Results: By time since immigration, Former Yugoslavian (ASR. =. 46.4) and Asian Arab (38.8) men, and Danish (23.3), Norwegian (19.5) and Finnish (14.5) women had the highest rates for lung cancer, while the lowest rate was seen among Asian Arab women (5.8). The highest adenocarcinoma rates were seen among South European men (11.5), and Danish (7.4) and Norwegian (6.9) women, while squamous cell (SCC) and small cell carcinomas rates were the highest among former Yugoslavian (16.0) and Baltic (8.8) men, respectively. Former Yugoslavian men (2.6) had the highest rate for large cell carcinoma. Compared to Swedes, former Yugoslavian men had the highest significant risk for SCC (SIR. =. 3.62), small cell (3.14) and large cell (4.21) carcinomas, whereas the highest adenocarcinoma risk was seen among Asian Arabs (2.35). Danish women had the highest risks for SCC (1.91) and small cell carcinoma (2.56). Conclusion: The ethnic-specific lung cancer rates by histology followed the rates in the countries of origin. Our findings may suggest that preservation of smoking habits in the host country is linked to the ethnic diversity of lung cancer incidence by histology. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","['Mousavi, S.M.', 'Sundquist, K.', 'Hemminki, K.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2011.10.022
"Changing urbanization patterns in US lung cancer mortality, 1950-2007.","This study examined disparities in lung cancer mortality rates among US men and women in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas from 1950 through 2007. Annual age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated for men and women in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, and differences in mortality rates were tested for statistical significance. Log-linear regression was used to model annual rates of change in mortality over time, while Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risk after adjusting for age, sex, deprivation, and urbanization levels. Urbanization patterns in lung cancer mortality changed dramatically between 1950 and 2007. Compared to men in metropolitan areas, men aged 25-64 years in non-metropolitan areas had significantly lower lung cancer mortality rates from 1950 to 1977 and men aged ≥65 years in non-metropolitan areas had lower mortality rates from 1950 to 1985. Differentials began to reverse and widen by the mid-1980s for men and by the mid-1990s for younger women. In 2007, compared to their metropolitan counterparts, men aged 25-64 and ≥65 years in non-metropolitan areas had 49 and 19% higher lung cancer mortality and women aged 25-64 and ≥65 years in non-metropolitan areas had 32 and 4% higher lung cancer mortality, respectively. Although adjustment for deprivation levels reduced excess lung cancer mortality risk among those in non-metropolitan areas, significant rural-urban differences remained. Rural-urban patterns reversed because of faster and earlier reductions in lung cancer mortality among men and women in metropolitan areas. Temporal trends in rural-urban disparities in lung cancer mortality appear to be consistent with those in smoking.","['Singh, G.K.', 'Siahpush, M.', 'Williams, S.D.']",10.1007/s10900-011-9458-3
"Cancer statistics, 2012","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,638,910 new cancer cases and 577,190 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2012. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2004-2008), overall cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8% per year in men and by 1.6% per year in women. Over the past 10 years of available data (1999-2008), cancer death rates have declined by more than 1% per year in men and women of every racial/ethnic group with the exception of American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates have remained stable. The most rapid declines in death rates occurred among African American and Hispanic men (2.4% and 2.3% per year, respectively). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate), with lung cancer accounting for almost 40% of the total decline in men and breast cancer accounting for 34% of the total decline in women. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 1,024,400 deaths from cancer. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.

Aspirin and NSAID use and lung cancer risk: A pooled analysis in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO),"Purpose: To investigate the hypothesis that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) lower lung cancer risk. Methods: We analysed pooled individual-level data from seven case-control and one cohort study in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO). Relative risks for lung cancer associated with self-reported history of aspirin and other NSAID use were estimated within individual studies using logistic regression or proportional hazards models, adjusted for packyears of smoking, age, calendar period, ethnicity and education and were combined using random effects meta-analysis. Results: A total of 4,309 lung cancer cases (mean age at diagnosis 65 years, 45% adenocarcinoma and 22% squamous-cell carcinoma) and 58,301 non-cases/controls were included. Amongst controls, 34% had used NSAIDs in the past (81% of them used aspirin). After adjustment for negative confounding by smoking, ever-NSAID use (affirmative answer to the study-specific question on NSAID use) was associated with a 26% reduction (95% confidence interval 8 to 41%) in lung cancer risk in men, but not in women (3% increase (-11% to 30%)). In men, the association was stronger in current and former smokers, and for squamous-cell carcinoma than for adenocarcinomas, but there was no trend with duration of use. No differences were found in the effects on lung cancer risk of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs. Conclusions: Evidence from ILCCO suggests that NSAID use in men confers a modest protection for lung cancer, especially amongst ever-smokers. Additional investigation is needed regarding the possible effects of age, duration, dose and type of NSAID and whether effect modification by smoking status or sex exists. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","['McCormack, V.A.', 'Hung, R.J.', 'Brenner, D.R.', 'Bickeböller, H.', 'Rosenberger, A.', 'Muscat, J.E.', 'Lazarus, P.', 'Tjønneland, A.', 'Friis, S.', 'Christiani, D.C.', 'Chun, E.-M.', 'Le Marchand, L.', 'Rennert, G.', 'Rennert, H.S.', 'Andrew, A.S.', 'Orlow, I.', 'Park, B.', 'Boffetta, P.', 'Duell, E.J.']",10.1007/s10552-011-9847-z
Is sublobar resection sufficient for carcinoid tumors?,"Background: The existing guidelines for extent of resection of carcinoid tumors are based on other, more malignant non-small cell lung cancers. Because of the small number of patients in any single institution, we analyzed the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database to study the effect of the extent of resection of these tumors on overall survival. Methods: All patients with lung cancer in the SEER database from 1973 to 2006 with carcinoid tumors as their only cancer were included. Variables examined included age, race (white, black, others), gender, histologic type (atypical versus typical carcinoid), stage (localized, regional, and distant), extent of resection (sublobar resection, lobectomy, or more extensive) and survival. Univariate analyses (Kaplan-Meier method) were used to select variables for multivariate analysis (Cox regression analysis). Associations were considered significant with an alpha error < 5%. In addition, propensity scorematched Cox regression analysis was performed for patients with typical carcinoid disease. Results: Most patients with carcinoid tumors did not acquire any other cancers (4,785/6,819; 70.2%). Of these, 797 patients had sublobar resection and 2,681 patients had lobectomy or more extensive resections. On univariate analysis, gender (p = 0.014), race (p < 0.001), stage (p < 0.001), histologic type (p < 0.001) and extent of resection (p = 0.04) were associated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, gender, race, stage, and histologic type remain statistically associated with overall survival and disease-specific survival, whereas extent of resection is not. Propensity scorematched analysis demonstrates that for typical carcinoid, extent of resection is not associated with overall survival when adjusted for age, gender, race, and stage. Conclusions: Sublobar resection of carcinoid tumors did not compromise oncologic outcomes in a large population-based database.

DerSimonian-Laird random effects analysis was used to estimate the pooled hazard ratio (HR). Results: We selected 39 articles as appropriate data sources, involving 86 800 patients including 32 701 women and 54 099 men. Combined HRs for women vs. men in studies using univariate and multivariate analyses respectively were 0.79 (p <0.0001) and 0.78 (p <0.0001). Pooled HRs for 3 study subgroups having (1) fewer than 30% stage I cases, (2) fewer than 50% adenocarcinoma cases, and (3) statistical adjustment for smoking status all indicated the survival advantage of women.

"Associations between regional socioeconomic deprivation and cancer risk: Analysis of Population-based Cancer Registry data from Bavaria, Germany","Objective: Previous research from other countries shows a positive association between cancer risk and regional deprivation. This study explores this association for lung and colorectal cancers in Germany. Method: Regional deprivation was assessed by the 'Bavarian Index of Multiple Deprivation'. Cancer data were provided by the Cancer Registry of Bavaria (2003-2006). The association between cancer risk and regional deprivation was evaluated by multilevel Poisson regression analysis. Results: Crude incidence and mortality rates (per 1000 people) in the least deprived areas were 1.46 and 0.92 for lung cancer, 2.82 and 0.69 for colorectal cancer. For lung cancer, the age-adjusted relative risk (RR) for incidence in the most deprived districts (compared with the least deprived) in men was 1.41 (95% CI: 1.28-1.54), for mortality 1.59 (95% CI: 1.40-1.80); in women, an elevated RR was seen for mortality (1.24, 95% CI: 1.06-1.46). For colorectal cancer, the RR for incidence (men: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.17-1.46; women: 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.40) and mortality (men: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.28-1.80; women: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.26-1.77) was always highest in the most deprived districts.

Profile of lung cancer: A one-year report,"Background: Lung cancer has been the most common cancer in the world since 1985 and the leading cause of cancer death. Worldwide it is by far the most common cancer of men and increasingly being recognized in Bangladesh. Objective: To observe the profile of lung cancer patients and the outcome of chemotherapy. Method: In one year (1st January'08 to 31st December'08) the lung cancer patients who attended the dept. of Medical Oncology were included in this study. The patient's history, clinical evaluation, previous treatment record (surgical intervention, chemotherapy and radiotherapy), histopathology and other investigation reports were documented. Chemotherapy and or supportive and symptomatic treatment carried out in the department were noted and response of the treatment were observed and documented. Result: Total number of patients was 701.Of them, 608 males and 93 females; male female ratio: 6.53:1. Common occurrence (> 85%) at and above 50 years of old; age range 25 years to 95 years and mean age 62 years; 44% was illiterate and 40% had primary school education; more than 82% belonged to poor and bellow average socioeconomic status. Previous records showed 524 patients (about 75%) attended after diagnosis and 177 cases (25%) had had prior treatment (6 by surgery, 22 by radiotherapy and 147 by chemotherapy). On clinical evaluation, almost all patients were symptomatic with WHO Grade-2 (44.51%) and Grade -3 (26.68%) performance status. Right lung was affected more (55%). Pathologically non-small cell carcinoma was 81.45% and small cell carcinoma 18.55%. But histopathology differed by sex; squamous cell carcinoma (43.42%) was most common in male but in female it was adenocarcinoma (55.92%). All most all cases were at inoperable stage (locally advanced/metastatic cancer/ medically unfit). Thirty percent of male patients and 45% of females dropped out after first and second visit. Around 20% patients got only supportive symptomatic management in both sexes and 326 patients (296 male and 30 female) were treated by chemotherapy. Within three to six months of treatment, 10% of the patients showed complete symptomatic relief, weight gaining and radiological disappearance of tumor and all most all patients benefited of some sorts of symptoms relief. Conclusion: The lung cancer patients were at inoperable stages with WHO Grade 2 and Grade 3 performance status in most of the cases; needed much more supportive and symptomatic treatment. Chemotherapy was effective; complete clinical and radiological response in 10% of cases and others got benefit with some sorts of symptoms relief and radiological improvement.","['Akhtar, P.S.', 'Masud, Z.M.', 'Alam, M.T.', 'Begum, M.']",10.3329/jom.v12i2.8417

To investigate a difference with a comparable representative sample from the Danish population, we sent out an inclusion questionnaire to 3999 Danes in the age from 50 to 70 years randomly selected from the Central National Register. Those who completed the inclusion questionnaire and met the inclusion criteria from DLCST received the COS-LC. Those who completed the COS-LC-and thus formed a population sample comparable to DLCST - were compared to the DLCST participants on socio-demographics and psychosocial measures. Results: Participation rates were high among the comparable population sample: 75.3% completed the inclusion questionnaire and 77.4% of those who were eligible completed the COS-LC. The analyses revealed differences between the DLCST participants and the comparable population sample in the following socio-demographic aspects: social group, living alone, gender, age and geographical area. DLCST participants reported less negative psychosocial aspects than the comparable population sample. Conclusion: The present study has shown substantial socio-demographic and psychosocial participation bias in DLCST. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","['Hestbech, M.S.', 'Siersma, V.', 'Dirksen, A.', 'Pedersen, J.H.', 'Brodersen, J.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2010.12.018
"Survival by histologic subtype in stage IV nonsmall cell lung cancer based on data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and end results program","Background: The role of histology in the targeted management of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has garnered renewed attention in recent years. We provide contemporary populationbased estimates of survival and an assessment of important prognostic factors in stage IV NSCLC by major histologic subtype. Methods: Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program, we stratified 51,749 incident stage IV NSCLC patients (1988-2003 with follow-up through 2006) by major histologic subtype. We used Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards methods to describe overall survival and the prognostic influence of select patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics for each histologic subgroup. Results: Survival was highest in patients with bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma (1-year survival: 29.1%) and lowest in those with large cell tumors (1-year survival: 12.8%). Diagnosis in later years, female gender, younger age, either Asian/Pacific Islander or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower tumor grade, and surgery or beam radiation as part of first-line treatment were generally independently associated with a decreased risk of death, but the prognostic significance of some of these factors (age, ethnicity, tumor grade) varied according to histologic subtype. Conclusion: Findings demonstrate a poor prognosis across histologic subtypes in stage IV NSCLC patients but highlight differences in both absolute survival and the relative importance of select prognostic factors by histologic subclassification. More research using other sources of population-based data could help clarify the role of histology in the presentation, management, and prognosis of late-stage NSCLC. © 2011 Cetin et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.

East meets west: Ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical behaviors of lung cancer between east Asians and Caucasians,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, with large variation of the incidence and mortality across regions. Although the mortality of lung cancer has been decreasing, or steady in the US, it has been increasing in Asia for the past two decades. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer, and other risk factors such as indoor coal burning, cooking fumes, and infections may play important roles in the development of lung cancer among Asian never smoking women. The median age of diagnosis in Asian patients with lung cancer is generally younger than Caucasian patients, particularly among never-smokers. Asians and Caucasians may have different genetic susceptibilities to lung cancer, as evidenced from candidate polymorphisms and genome-wide association studies. Recent epidemiologic studies and clinical trials have shown consistently that Asian ethnicity is a favorable prognostic factor for overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), independent of smoking status. Compared with Caucasian patients with NSCLC, East Asian patients have a much higher prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation (approximately 30% vs. 7%, predominantly among patients with adenocarcinoma and never-smokers), a lower prevalence of K-Ras mutation (less than 10% vs. 18%, predominantly among patients with adenocarcinoma and smokers), and higher proportion of patients who are responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The ethnic differences in epidemiology and clinical behaviors should be taken into account when conducting global clinical trials that include different ethnic populations.","['Zhou, W.', 'Christiani, D.C.']",10.5732/cjc.011.10106
Explaining low mortality among US immigrants relative to native-born Americans: The role of smoking,"Background: In many developed countries, immigrants live longer-that is, have lower death rates at most or all ages-than native-born residents. This article tests whether different levels of smoking-related mortality can explain part of the 'healthy immigrant effect' in the USA, as well as part of the related 'Hispanic paradox': the tendency for US Hispanics to outlive non-Hispanic Whites. Methods: With data from vital statistics and the national census, we calculate lung cancer death rates in 2000 for four US subpopulations: foreign-born, native-born, Hispanic and non-Hispanic White. We then use three different methods-the Peto-Lopez method, the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth method and a novel method developed in this article-to generate three alternative estimates of smokingrelated mortality for each of the four subpopulations, extrapolating from lung cancer death rates. We then measure the contribution of smoking-related mortality to disparities in all-cause mortality. Results: Taking estimates from any of the three methods, we find that smoking explains 450% of the difference in life expectancy at 50 years between foreign- and native-born men, and 470% of the difference between foreign- and native-born women; smoking explains475% of the difference in life expectancy at 50 years between US Hispanic and non-Hispanic White men, and close to 75% of the Hispanic advantage among women. Conclusions: Low smoking-related mortality was the main reason for immigrants' and Hispanics' longevity advantage in the USA in 2000.

Cancer-related chronic pain,"BACKGROUND: Disparities in cancer survival and pain rates negatively impact quality of life (QOL). This study examines cancer-related chronic pain (CP) and its impact on QOL in diverse cancer survivors. METHODS: This survey study focused on current and past pain, health, and QOL in black and white cancer survivors. Participants with breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer and multiple myeloma were recruited through the Michigan State Cancer Registry. Analysis of variance was used to examine outcome differences by pain status, race, and sex. Hierarchical regressions explored predictors for experiencing pain. RESULTS: The subjects (N = 199) were 31% black, 49% female, and 57 to 79 years old; 19.5% experienced current pain, and 42.6% reported pain since diagnosis. Women experience more pain (P <.001) and greater pain severity (P =.04) than men. Blacks experienced more pain interference and disability (P <.05). Experiencing pain is related to greater depressive symptoms, poorer functioning, and more symptoms. In hierarchical regressions, female sex predicted pain since diagnosis; pain severity for pain since diagnosis was predicted by black race and female sex. CONCLUSIONS: The authors extend the literature by showing that 20% of diverse cancer survivors had cancer-related CP, and 43% had experienced pain since diagnosis, revealing racial and sex disparities in cancer-related CP's incidence and impact on QOL. Having pain was related to poorer QOL in several domains and was more frequently experienced by women. Although black race was not related to pain prevalence, it was related to greater severity. This study reveals an unaddressed cancer survivorship research, clinical, and policy issue.

Optimizing response to gefitinib in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is expressed in the majority of non- small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, only a restricted subgroup of NSCLC patients respond to treatment with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) gefitinib. Clinical trials have demonstrated that patients carrying activating mutations of the EGFR significantly benefit from treatment with gefitinib. In particular, mutations of the EGFR TK domain have been shown to increase the sensitivity of the EGFR to exogenous growth factors and, at the same time, to EGFR TKIs such as gefitinib. EGFR mutations are more frequent in patients with particular clinical and pathological features such as female sex, nonsmoker status, adenocarcinoma histology, and East Asian ethnicity. A close correlation was found between EGFR mutations and response to gefitinib in NSCLC patients. More importantly, randomized Phase III studies have shown the superiority of gefitinib compared with chemotherapy in EGFR mutant patients in the first-line setting. In addition, gefitinib showed a good toxicity profile with an incidence of adverse events that was significantly lower compared with chemotherapy. Therefore, gefitinib is a major breakthrough for the management of EGFR mutant NSCLC patients and represents the first step toward personalized treatment of NSCLC. © 2011 Carotenuto et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd.","['Carotenuto, P.', 'Roma, C.', 'Rachiglio, A.M.', 'Pasquale, R.', 'Franco, R.', 'Antinolfi, G.', 'Piantedosi, F.', 'Illiano, A.', 'Botti, G.', 'Morabito, A.', 'Normanno, N.', 'de Luca, A.']",10.2147/PGPM.S6626
Systematic review of the epidemiological evidence comparing lung cancer risk in smokers of mentholated and unmentholated cigarettes,"Background: US mentholated cigarette sales have increased considerably over 50 years. Preference for mentholated cigarettes is markedly higher in Black people. While menthol itself is not genotoxic or carcinogenic, its acute respiratory effects might affect inhalation of cigarette smoke. This possibility seems consistent with the higher lung cancer risk in Black men, despite Black people smoking less and starting smoking later than White people. Despite experimental data suggesting similar carcinogenicity of mentholated and non-mentholated cigarettes, the lack of convincing evidence that mentholation increases puffing, inhalation or smoke uptake, and the similarity of lung cancer rates in Black and White females, a review of cigarette mentholation and lung cancer is timely given current regulatory interest in the topic.Methods: Epidemiological studies comparing lung cancer risk in mentholated and non-mentholated cigarette smokers were identified from MedLine and other sources. Study details were extracted and strengths and weaknesses assessed. Relative risk estimates were extracted, or derived, for ever mentholated use and for long-term use, overall and by gender, race, and current/ever smoking, and meta-analyses conducted.Results: Eight generally good quality studies were identified, with valid cases and controls, and appropriate adjustment for age, gender, race and smoking. The studies afforded good power to detect possible effects. However, only one study presented results by histological type, none adjusted for occupation or diet, and some provided no results by length of mentholated cigarette use.The data do not suggest any effect of mentholation on lung cancer risk. Adjusted relative risk estimates for ever use vary from 0.81 to 1.12, giving a combined estimate of 0.93 (95% confidence interval 0.84-1.02, n = 8), with no increase in males (1.01, 0.84-1.22, n = 5), females (0.80, 0.67-0.95, n = 5), White people (0.87, 0.75-1.03, n = 4) or Black people (0.90, 0.73-1.10, n = 4). Estimates for current and ever smokers are similar. The combined estimate for long-term use (0.95, 0.80-1.13, n = 4) again suggests no effect of mentholation.Conclusion: Higher lung cancer rates in Black males cannot be due to their greater preference for mentholated cigarettes. While some study weaknesses exist, the epidemiological evidence is consistent with mentholation having no effect on the lung carcinogenicity of cigarettes. © 2011 Lee; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","['Lee, P.N.']",10.1186/1471-2466-11-18
"Urban/rural patterns in receipt of treatment for non-small cell lung cancer among black and white medicare beneficiaries, 2000-2003","Background: Receipt of treatment for lung cancer varies by a number of demographic factors, including race/ethnicity and urban/rural residence. We examined urban/rural patterns in receipt of treatment for non-mall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (ie, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) among black and white Medicare beneficiaries in Alabama. Methods: After linking Alabama State Cancer Registry data with state Medicare data, we identified 3481 cases of stages I to IV and unknown-stage NSCLC diagnosed from 2000-2002 and obtained their treatment data for 1999-2003. We used bivariate and multivariate analyses to examine racial and urban/rural differences in receipt of treatment. Significant bivariate associations were tested using c2 tests. Results: Among beneficiaries with resectable NSCLC (ie, stages I-IIIA), urban whites were more likely to undergo surgical resection than urban blacks (49.3% vs 33.0%, respectively), and more rural whites than rural blacks (49.8% vs 23.9%, respectively) underwent surgery. There was less variation by race and urban/rural residence in the receipt of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. After controlling for age at diagnosis, gender, stage at diagnosis, comorbidity score, and socioeconomic status, the racial disparity for surgery remained. Black beneficiaries in urban counties had 45% lower odds of undergoing surgery than urban white beneficiaries (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.31-0.96), and those in rural counties had 67% lower odds of receiving this treatment than their white counterparts (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.57). Conclusions: Differences in receipt of surgery exist for both urban and rural black Alabamians with NSCLC. Future studies should explore access to care and perceptions about treatment among lung cancer patients in this state.","['Steele, C.B.', 'Pisu, M.', 'Richardson, L.C.']",10.1016/s0027-9684(15)30410-7
Racial disparities in smoking knowledge among current smokers: Data from the health information national trends surveys,"Although African-Americans (Blacks) smoke fewer cigarettes per day than European-Americans (Whites), there is ample evidence that Blacks are more susceptible to smoking-related health consequences. A variety of behavioural, social and biological factors have been linked to this increased risk. There has been little research, however, on racial differences in smoking-related knowledge and perceived risk of lung cancer. The primary goal of the current study was to evaluate beliefs and knowledge that contribute to race disparities in lung cancer risk among current smokers. Data from two separate nationally representative surveys (the Health Information National Trends surveys 2003 and 2005) were analysed. Logistic and hierarchical regressions were conducted; gender, age, education level, annual household income and amount of smoking were included as covariates. In both studies, Black smokers were significantly more likely to endorse inaccurate statements than were White smokers, and did not estimate their lung cancer risk to be significantly higher than Whites. Results highlight an important racial disparity in public health knowledge among current smokers. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.","['Reimer, R.A.', 'Gerrard, M.', 'Gibbons, F.X.']",10.1080/08870440902935913
Burden of lung cancer deaths due to smoking for men and women in the WHO Western Pacific and South East Asian regions,"Introduction: Eighty percent of all smokers live in low and middle-income countries of the Asia Pacific region but actual estimates of the burden of disease due to smoking in the region have yet to be quantified. Methods: The burden of lung cancer due to smoking for all countries in the WHO Western Pacific and South East Asian regions was calculated from the population attributable fractions (PAFs). Nationally representative sex-specific prevalences of smoking were obtained from the World Health Organization, MEDLINE and/or national government documents and hazard ratios (HR) for lung cancer due to smoking in Asian and non-Asian populations were obtained from published data. The HR and prevalence were then used to calculate PAFs for lung cancer deaths due to smoking, by gender and by country. Results: The national prevalence of smoking in the Asia Pacific region ranged from 18-65% in men and from 0-50% in women. The fraction of lung cancer deaths attributable to smoking ranged from 0-40% in Asian women and from 21-49% in Asian men. In ANZ, PAFs were as high as 80% for women and 68% for men. Future estimates of the burden of smoking-related lung cancer in Asia were obtained by assuming a continuation of current smoking habits in these populations. Extrapolating the higher HR from the ANZ region to Asia, resulted in an increase in the PAFs to 4-90% in women and from 62-85% in men. Conclusion: The current burden of lung-cancer due to smoking in the Asia-Pacific region is substantial accounting for up to 50% of deaths from the disease in men and up to 40% in women depending on the country. If current smoking habits in Asia remain unchanged then the number of people dying from smoking-related lung cancer over the next couple of decades is expected to double. It is known that the majority of lung cancer is due to smoking. This is the first paper to systematically compare current burdens of lung cancer deaths due to smoking in countries in the Western Pacific and South East Asia and by gender. Findings from this paper demonstrate the number of lung cancer deaths that could be prevented if the prevalence of smoking was eliminated.","['Martiniuk, A.', 'Lee, C.M.Y.', 'Woodward, M.', 'Huxley, R.']",
"Cancer incidence and mortality in populations living near uranium milling and mining operations in grants, New Mexico, 1950-2004","In a previous cohort study of workers engaged in uranium milling and mining activities near Grants, Cibola County, New Mexico, we found lung cancer mortality to be significantly increased among underground miners. Uranium mining took place from early in the 1950s to 1990, and the Grants Uranium Mill operated from 19581990. The present study evaluates cancer mortality during 19502004 and cancer incidence during 19822004 among county residents. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence (SIR) ratios and 95 confidence intervals (CI) were computed, with observed numbers of cancer deaths and cases compared to expected values based on New Mexico cancer rates. The total numbers of cancer deaths and incident cancers were close to that expected (SMR 1.04, 95 CI 1.011.07; SIR 0.97, 95 CI 0.921.02). Lung cancer mortality and incidence were significantly increased among men (SMR 1.11, 95 CI 1.021.21; SIR 1.40, 95 CI 1.181.64) but not women (SMR 0.97, 95 CI 0.851.10; SIR 1.01, 95 CI 0.781.29). Similarly, among the population of the three census tracts near the Grants Uranium Mill, lung cancer mortality was significantly elevated among men (SMR 1.57; 95 CI 1.211.99) but not women (SMR 1.12; 95 CI 0.751.61). Except for an elevation in mortality for stomach cancer among women (SMR 1.30; 95 CI 1.031.63), which declined over the 55-year observation period, no significant increases in SMRs or SIRs for 22 other caners were found. Although etiological inferences cannot be drawn from these ecological data, the excesses of lung cancer among men seem likely to be due to previously reported risks among underground miners from exposure to radon gas and its decay products. Smoking, socioeconomic factors or ethnicity may also have contributed to the lung cancer excesses observed in our study. The stomach cancer increase was highest before the uranium mill began operation and then decreased to normal levels. With the exception of male lung cancer, this study provides no clear or consistent evidence that the operation of uranium mills and mines adversely affected cancer incidence or mortality of county residents. © 2010 by Radiation Research Society.","['Boice Jr., J.D.', 'Mumma, M.T.', 'Blot, W.J.']",10.1667/RR2180.1
Epidemiology of lung cancers in France. Sociological and occupational factors,"Lung cancer remains the most deadly cancer with 28,900 deaths estimated for 2010 in France. Its incidence seems to be stabilizing with 36,879 new cases estimated in 2010, three-quarters in males. These overall statistics mask an increase in the standardized incidence rate of lung cancer in females, rising from 9.5 to 17.8% over the last decade. Scandinavian studies have shown a greater increase of the incidence in blue-collar workers in both sexes. The French AGRICAN study confirms a low incidence in farmers. In France, occupational etiologies account for 12% of lung cancer cancers in males and 6% in females. The main occupational risk factor remains exposure to asbestos, ahead of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals (chromium, nickel, cadmium, and arsenic).Survival at 1 year and 5 years is, respectively, 46% and 18% in women and 42% and 13% in men. At 5 years, survival decreases in relation to age: 20% in 15 to 45-year-olds, dropping to 8% in patients 75 years of age and older. Whatever age group is considered, however, the prognosis is always better for women than for men. Socioeconomic conditions also influence survival, with a European study showing differences in survival between the extreme quantiles of socioeconomic status on the order of 10% at 1 year and 7% at 3 years. In the studies conducted in France, the role played by geographical inequalities is also highlighted (between urban and rural zones).The Cancer Plan II has identified the reduction of social inequalities in cancer as a national priority. © 2010 Société de Pneumologie de Langue Française (SPLF).","['Launoy, G.']",10.1016/S1877-1203(10)70052-5
Lung cancer surgery in the breathless patient - the benefits of avoiding the gold standard,"Objective: Lung cancer resection in breathless patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains controversial. Whilst open lobectomy remains the gold standard, alternative approaches have been described. We undertook a retrospective, observational study to compare the outcomes of a tailored strategy combining video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy and anatomical segmentectomy against open lobectomy in these patients. Method: Clinical outcomes were studied in 84 consecutive patients (male:female ratio was 56:28, mean age 69.0 years, median preoperative-forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 41%) with a predicted-postoperative FEV1 ≤40% (median 32.8% and range 14-40%) who underwent anatomical lung resection for lung cancer. The control group consisted of 35 patients who underwent open lobectomy. The study group comprised 27 patients who underwent anatomical segmentectomy, 18 who underwent VATS lobectomy and four who underwent VATS segmentectomy. Results: There were no significant inter-group differences in age (p = 0.87), gender (p = 0.49), preoperative FEV1 (p = 0.30) or cardiac co-morbidities (p = 0.78). There were more upper lobe resections in the control group (51% vs 94%, p < 0.0001). Tumour size tended to be smaller in the study group (p = 0.052). There were also more incidences of stage I cancers in the study group (90% vs 71%, p = 0.043). The median length of hospital stay was shorter in the study group (8 vs 12 days, p = 0.054). There was no significant difference in either in-hospital mortality (8% vs 14%, p = 0.48) or recurrence rate (26% vs 20%, p = 0.60). However, unadjusted survival was significantly longer in the study group (median survival 54 months vs 20 months, 5-year survival 42% vs 18%, p = 0.03). The survival benefit of this group remained significant in multivariate analyses (adjusted survival hazard ratio (HR) 2.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30-4.39, p = 0.005). A subgroup analysis on only uncomplicated stage I cancers found a similarly worse outcome in the control group (p = 0.002). After segregating surgical approach and the extent of resection, the VATS approach was identified as the critical factor conferring survival advantage to the study group (hazard ratio (HR) 2.78, 95% CI: 1.21-6.37, p = 0.016). Conclusions: Despite a tailored approach to patients with severe pulmonary dysfunction, there was still significant disparity in survival between groups. Patients who underwent open lobectomy have a worse outcome despite adjusting for confounders. This survival benefit was driven by thoracotomy avoidance through VATS resection.

"The influence of gender, race, and marital status on survival in lung cancer patients: Analysis of radiation therapy oncology group trials","Objective: A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the influence of gender, race, and marital status on overall survival (OS) in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group nonoperative non-small cell lung cancer trials. Materials and Methods: Data from 1365 patients treated on nine prospective Radiation Therapy Oncology Group studies activated during the 1990s were analyzed. Impact of gender, marital status, and race was considered in the Cox proportional hazards models. Age, Karnofsky performance status, weight loss, stage, histology, location of primary tumor, biologic equivalent dose, deviation from protocol dose, and education level were adjusted in the model. A two-sided p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Males had significantly higher mortality than females adjusted for other covariates (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22, 95% confidence interval = 1.08-1.38). Race and marital status were not independently predictive for OS. Single females had significantly better OS than single males (HR = 0.72), and married males had lower OS than single females (HR = 1.36). Conclusions: These results suggest that although certain subgroups of gender, race, and/or marital status have better outcomes with respect to OS; gender seems to be the most significant factor influencing survival results among nonoperative non-small cell lung cancer patients. © 2010 by the International Association for the study of lung cancer.","['Siddiqui, F.', 'Bae, K.', 'Langer, C.J.', 'Coyne, J.C.', 'Gamerman, V.', 'Komaki, R.', 'Choy, H.', 'Curran, W.J.', 'Watkins-Bruner, D.', 'Movsas, B.']",10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181d5e46a
Clinical significance of NQO1 C609T polymorphisms after postoperative radiation therapy in completely resected non-small cell lung cancer,"Purpose: To investigate the clinical significance of NQO1 C609T polymorphisms to treatment outcome after postoperative radiation therapy in completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: One hundred and sixteen, Korean-ethnic, patients who were treated with surgery and postoperative radiation therapy from February 2000 to September 2005 in Asan Medical Center (Seoul, South Korea) were analyzed. All patients received 5040. cGy radiation to surgical stump, mediastinum and ipsilateral supraclavicular node. NQO1 C609T polymorphisms were examined from a peripheral blood sample in all patients. Three types of NQO1 C609T polymorphisms were designated as C/C, C/T and T/T. Chest computed tomography was routinely checked after radiation therapy at every 3 or 6 months and locoregional tumor control, distant metastasis and survival by NQO1 C609T genotype were analyzed. Results: The proportion of NQO1 C609T polymorphisms was 27.6% for C/C, 53.4% for C/T and 19.0% for T/T. Most patients were men and had squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Median age of patients was 61 years. Major failure pattern was distant metastasis and 13 (11.2%) patients showed locoregional recurrence within the field of previous radiation therapy. Crude locoregional recurrence rate was significantly different by NQO1 genotype; 6.3% in C/C, 8.1% in C/T, and 27.3% in T/T (p=0.03), but distant metastasis was not different. Median follow-up time was 49.2 months (range: 3.4-103.5 months). Locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) was affected in T/T genotype compared with C/C or C/T genotype (p=0.01, Kaplan-Meier method), but distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) or overall survival (OS) was not different by NQO1 genotype in univariate analysis. NQO1 genotype was also a significant factor for LRRFS (p=0.01) in multivariate analysis. Radiation-induced pneumonitis or esophagitis was tolerable in all patients and the difference by NQO1 genotype was not observed.

Social inequalities in non-small cell lung cancer management and survival: A population-based study in central Sweden,"Objectives: To examine possible associations between socioeconomic status, management and survival of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: In a population-based cohort study, information was retrieved from the Regional Lung Cancer Register in central Sweden, the Cause of Death Register and a social database. ORs and HRs were compared to assess associations between educational level and management and survival. Results: 3370 eligible patients with an NSCLC diagnosis between 1996 and 2004 were identified. There were no differences in stage at diagnosis between educational groups. A higher diagnostic intensity was observed in patients with high compared with low education. There were also social gradients in time between referral and diagnosis in early stage disease (median time: low, 32 days; high, 17 days). Social differences in treatment remained following adjustment for prognostic factors (surgery in early stage disease, high vs low OR 2.84; CI 1.40 to 5.79). Following adjustment for prognostic factors and treatment, the risk of death in early stage disease was lower in women with a high education (high vs low HR 0.33; CI 0.14 to 0.77). Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups with NSCLC receive less intensive care. Low education remained an independent predictor of poor survival only in women with early stage disease. The exact underlying mechanisms of these social inequalities are unknown, but differences in access to care, co-morbidity and lifestyle factors may all contribute.","['Berglund, A.', 'Holmberg, L.', 'Tishelman, C.', 'Wagenius, G.', 'Eaker, S.', 'Lambe, M.']",10.1136/thx.2009.125914
A comparison study of clinicopathologic characteristics of southern California Asian American non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients by smoking status,"BACKGROUND:: We previously reported that Asian ethnicity is a favorable prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients independent of smoking status. However, Asian ethnicity represents a diverse and heterogeneous population.

RESULTS:: One thousand one hundred twenty-four NSCLC patients were analyzed: Filipino American (37.0%), Vietnamese American (32.8%), Japanese American (11.8%), Chinese American (11.7%), and Korean American (6.7%). A total of 25.7% of these patients were never smokers. With the exception of Japanese American, most of Asian American were native born. Median age of never smokers was marginally younger than ever smokers (66 years versus 68 years, respectively, p = 0.0507). The proportion of never smokers who were women was 72.7% and ranged from the lowest among Korean American women (66.7%) to the highest among Japanese American women (84.2%). Among female patients, Vietnamese American patients had the highest proportion of being never smokers (65.5%). Significantly more never smokers (60.9%) than ever smokers (47.9%) presented with stage 4 disease. There was no statistical significant difference in OS between never smokers and ever smokers (11 versus 10 months; p = 0.3040). Tumor-related factors (stage and histologic differentiation) and treatment (surgery and chemotherapy) were independent prognostic factors for survival. CONCLUSIONS:: We found no statistical significant difference in clinicopathologic features or survival outcome between individual Asian American subgroup when analyzed according to smoking status. © 2010 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.","['Ou, S.-H.I.', 'Ziogas, A.', 'Zell, J.A.']",10.1097/JTO.0b013e3181c8cc62
"Mortality in 272 European regions, 2002-2004. An update","This paper presents a comprehensive update of life expectancy and mortality in 2002-2004 in the modern European Union (EU-27) and EFTA countries. We focus on causes of death at younger ages (0-64 year). EUROSTAT delivered updated population numbers and mortality data by sex, age and cause of death for 272 NUTS-2 regions. We compared mortality by life tables, cause decomposition life tables and age standardized rates. Gini coefficients estimated inequity of death rates over the regions. Life expectancy at birth in the EU-27 was 75.1 years (men) and 81.3 years (women). The difference between the 10th and 90th percentile of 272 regions was 8.0 (men) and 5.6 years (women). Men lived 6.1 years shorter in the new member states (NMS, new members since 2004) than in the EU-15 (members before 2004), women 3.9 years. 60% (men) and 33% (women) of the differences in life expectancy between EU 15 and NMS were explained by mortality under age 65. The main causes explaining differences in life expectancy were ischemic and other heart disease, stroke, alcohol related mortality, lung cancer and injuries. The fraction of ill defined causes of death was large and very variable between countries. Mortality differences in the EU-27 are dominated by smoking, alcohol, diseases related to diet and a sedentary lifestyle, unsafe roads and differences in health care performance. Closing the health gap is feasible and ought to be a major target of the European Union, but monitoring will need better registration of causes of death. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","['Bonneux, L.G.', 'Huisman, C.C.', 'De Beer, J.A.']",10.1007/s10654-009-9415-y
Inequalities in mortality in small areas of eleven Spanish cities (the multicenter MEDEA project),"The objectives of this study are to identify inequalities in mortality among census tracts of 11 Spanish cities in the period 1996-2003 and to analyse the relationship between these geographical inequalities and socioeconomic deprivation. It is a cross-sectional ecological study where the units of analysis are census tracts. We obtained an index of socioeconomic deprivation and estimated SMR by each census tract using hierarchical Bayesian models which take into account the spatial structure. In the majority of the cities geographical patterns in total mortality were found in both sexes, which were similar to those for the index of socioeconomic deprivation. Among men, four specific causes of death (lung cancer, ischemic heart diseases, respiratory diseases and cirrhosis) were positively associated with deprivation in the majority of cities. Among women the specific causes diabetes and cirrhosis were positively associated, while lung cancer was negatively associated with deprivation. The excess of mortality related with deprivation was 59,445 deaths among men and 23,292 among women. These results highlight the importance of intra-urban inequalities in health. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","['Borrell, C.', ""Marí-Dell'Olmo, M."", 'Serral, G.', 'Martínez-Beneito, M.', 'Gotsens, M.']",10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.03.002
Gender-related disparities in non-small cell lung cancer,"Epidemiological studies clearly outline some disparities in cancer onset, progression as well as prognosis and therapeutic response between sexes. In particular, in lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, at least in Western countries, a gender disparity appears now to emerge, especially for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Such a disparity is apparently due to a variety of mechanisms, ranging from genetic and epigenetic differences to gender-specific lifestyle as well as to behavioral causes and, clearly, to sex hormones activity. Here we briefly recapitulate gender differences in terms of risk factors, histopathological features and pathogenetic mechanisms in NSCLC, and hypothesize that a gender-oriented pharmacology could beneficially impact on innovative therapeutic strategies. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","['Paggi, M.G.', 'Vona, R.', 'Abbruzzese, C.', 'Malorni, W.']",10.1016/j.canlet.2010.08.009
EGFR and KRAS mutations in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung,"Background/Aims: Mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) are important in the pathogenesis of lung cancer, and recent reports have revealed racial and geographical differences in mutation expression. Methods: This study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of EGFR and KRAS mutations and their correlation with clinical variables in Korean patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Formalin-fixed adenocarcinoma specimens from 104 randomly selected patients diagnosed at Kosin University Gospel Hospital from October 1996 to January 2005 were used for the study. Results: We found a high prevalence of EGFR mutations and a low prevalence of KRAS mutations. EGFR mutations were present in 24% (25 of 104) of the samples: one mutation in exon 18, 13 in exon 19, one in exon 20, and 10 in exon 21. The presence of an EGFR mutation was not associated with gender, smoking history, histological grade, age, bronchioalveolar components, or cancer stage in patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung. Conclusions: Mutations of KRAS were present in 9.6% (9 of 94) of the samples: eight in codon 12 and one in codon 13. EGFR mutations were never found in tumors with KRAS mutations, suggesting a mutually exclusive relationship.","['Jang, T.W.', 'Oak, C.H.', 'Chang, H.K.', 'Suo, S.J.', 'Jung, M.H.']",10.3904/kjim.2009.24.1.48
Treatment outcomes of different prognostic groups of patients on Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 39801: Induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy alone for unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: In Cancer and Leukemia Group B 39801, we evaluated whether induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemoradiotherapy would result in improved survival and demonstrated no significant benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy. The primary objective of this analysis was to dichotomize patients into prognostic groups using factors predictive of survival and to investigate whether induction chemotherapy was beneficial in either prognostic group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the impact on survival of the following factors: (≥70 versus <70 years), gender, race, stage (IIIB versus IIIA), hemoglobin (hgb) (<13 versus ≥13 g/dl), performance status (PS) (1 versus 0), weight loss (≥5% versus <5%), treatment arm, and the interaction between weight loss and hgb. RESULTS: Factors predictive of decreased survival were weight loss ≥5%, age ≥70 years, PS of 1, and hgb <13 g/dl (p < 0.05). Patients were classified as having ≥2 poor prognostic factors (n = 165) or ≤1 factor (n = 166). The hazard ratio (HR) for overall survival for the patients with ≥2 versus patients with ≤1 was 1.88 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.49-2.37; p = <0.0001]; median survival times observed were 9 (95% CI, 8-11) and 18 (95% CI, 16-24) months, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival between treatment arms in patients with ≥2 factors (HR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.63-1.17; p = 0.34) or ≤1 factor (HR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.70-1.35; p = 0.87).

Cancer patient ethnicity and associations with emotional distress - The 6th vital sign: A new look at defining patient ethnicity in a multicultural context,"Variations in access to care, utilization of available resources and treatment outcomes in the context of ethnicity have been recognized, but very little research of this nature exists in the oncology context. The present paper is an in-depth analysis of data on a large representative sample of Canadian cancer patients with a focus on the role of 'ethnicity', its association to psychological distress, and its impact on the cancer experience. Because of a heterogeneous representation of ethnic self-identifications which were not easily grouped or classified, English as a second language was considered as a surrogate marker to ethnicity. People who self-reported to be from an English-speaking country were grouped together and compared to those hailing from countries which do not have English as a primary language. In a hierarchical logistic regression model (n = 2,402) the demographic and cancer-related variables associated with significant clinical distress in the first block were gender (male, except those with prostate cancer), age less that 68 years, less than a year since diagnosis, diagnosis of lung cancer, and recurrent disease. In the second block, after controlling for the influence of these factors, patient-reported ethnicity (being originally from a non-English speaking country) added significantly to the prediction of patient distress. Though compelling, there is a need to understand the relationship between the ethnic features and language (English versus non-English language). A hypothesis is presented as an attempt to understand an individual's 'ethnicity' within the framework of a multicultural society. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.","['Thomas, B.C.', 'Carlson, L.E.', 'Bultz, B.D.']",10.1007/s10903-008-9180-0
Race and sex differences in the receipt of timely and appropriate lung cancer treatment,"Background: Previous research suggests that disparities in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survival can be explained in part by disparities in the receipt of cancer treatment. Few studies, however, have considered race and sex disparities in the timing and appropriateness of treatment across stages of diagnosis. Objective: To evaluate the relationship of sex and race with the receipt of timely and clinically appropriate NSCLC treatment for each stage of diagnosis. Method: Surveillance Epidemiology and End Result data linked to Medicare claims for beneficiaries diagnosed with NSCLC between 1995 and 1999 were used to evaluate the relationship between race and sex with timely and appropriate NSCLC treatment while controlling for other demographic characteristics, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and provider supply (N = 22,145). Results: Overall adjusted rates of timely and appropriate treatment are 37.2%, 58.1%, and 29.2% for Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with stage I or II, III, and IV NSCLC, respectively. Among stage I or II patients, women were 25% less likely to receive timely surgical resection relative to men, and blacks were 66% less likely to receive timely and appropriate treatment than whites. Black men were least likely to receive resection (22.2% compared with 43.7% for white men). Blacks were 34% less likely to receive timely surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation for stage III disease and were 51% less likely to receive chemotherapy in a timely fashion for stage IV disease relative to whites. Conclusion: Significant variations in appropriate timely treatment were found within and across stages of diagnosis, confirming that sex and race differences in NSCLC treatment exist. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","['Shugarman, L.R.', 'MacK, K.', 'Sorbero, M.E.S.', 'Tian, H.', 'Jain, A.K.', 'Ashwood, J.S.', 'Asch, S.M.']",10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181a393fe
"Trends in the outcomes for patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer: An analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database","We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to examine the outcomes of patients with limited stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) over time and to determine if any trends were present with respect to the publication of significant clinical trials. We assembled a cohort of 6271 patients aged 21 years and older with LS-SCLC diagnosed from 1983 to 1998 and followed through 2005. Potential covariates included patient age at diagnosis, sex, race, year of diagnosis, laterality, tumor size, and location (upper lobe, middle lobe, lower lobe, or main bronchus). In multivariate analysis, older age, male sex, African American race, and main bronchus location were all associated with a statistically significant increase in the mortality hazard. When compared to patients diagnosed in 1983-1987 who did not receive radiotherapy, the hazard for mortality was significantly reduced for patients diagnosed in 1988-1992 regardless of whether they received radiotherapy (HR = 0.59; CI 0.52-0.65; p < 0.0001) or not (HR = 0.67; CI 0.60-0.75; p < 0.0001). Patients who were diagnosed in 1993-1998 and received radiotherapy had similarly improved survival (HR = 0.53; CI 0.47-0.58; p < 0.0001), which was better than patients from the same time era who did not receive radiotherapy (HR = 0.77; CI 0.69-0.85; p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the survival for patients with LS-SCLC has improved over time. Many factors are likely involved, however we believe that part of this improvement was the result of clinical trials which investigated and subsequently defined chemoradiotherapy as the standard of care. In order to continue to improve clinical outcomes, clinical trials investigating new treatment paradigms are needed. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The role of smoking and diet in explaining educational inequalities in lung cancer incidence,"Background: Studies in many countries have reported higher lung cancer incidence and mortality in individuals with lower socioeconomic status. Methods: To investigate the role of smoking in these inequalities, we used data from 391 251 participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, a cohort of individuals in 10 European countries. We collected information on smoking (history and quantity), fruit and vegetable consumption, and education through questionnaires at study entry and gathered data on lung cancer incidence for a mean of 8.4 years. Socioeconomic status was defined as the highest attained level of education, and participants were grouped by sex and region of residence (Northern Europe, Germany, or Southern Europe). Relative indices of inequality (RIIs) of lung cancer risk unadjusted and adjusted for smoking were estimated using Cox regression models. Additional analyses were performed by histological type. Results: During the study period, 939 men and 692 women developed lung cancer. Inequalities in lung cancer risk (RII men = 3.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.77 to 4.73, 117 vs 52 per 100 000 person-years for lowest vs highest education level; RII women = 2.39, 95% CI = 1.77 to 3.21, 46 vs 25 per 100 000 person-years) decreased after adjustment for smoking but remained statistically significant (RIImen = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.75 to 3.01; RII women = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.13). Large RIIs were observed among men and women in Northern European countries and among men in Germany, but inequalities in lung cancer risk were reverse (RIIs < 1) among women in Southern European countries. Inequalities differed by histological type. Adjustment for smoking reduced inequalities similarly for all histological types and among men and women in all regions. In all analysis, further adjustment for fruit and vegetable consumption did not change the estimates. Conclusion: Self-reported smoking consistently explains approximately 50% of the inequalities in lung cancer risk due to differences in education. © The Author 2009.

Psychological distress and cancer mortality,"Background: Psychological distress, such as ongoing depression and anxiety-related symptomatology, has been associated with a higher risk of incident cancer and poorer survival, although previous studies have not compared prognostic and etiological effects within the same sample. We examined the association between psychological distress and cancer mortality in a sample comprising participants with and without previous cancer admissions. Methods: Data were collected from a community-based sample of 15,453 men and women (including 295 people with cancer history) and prospectively linked to a patient-based database of cancer registry and deaths during an average follow-up of 7.0±3.3 years. Psychological distress was assessed using the 12-item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results: There were 425 incident cancer deaths. Psychological distress (GHQ-12 ≥4) was associated with increased cancer mortality in participants with cancer history [age, gender, social status, marital status, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, and physical activity; adjusted hazard ratio (HR)=1.97; 95% confidence interval (95% CI)=1.05-3.71; P=.035], but not in participants without cancer history. Among participants without cancer history, there was, however, an association between distress and lung cancer death (age- and gender-adjusted HR=2.04; 95% CI=1.36-3.06; P=.001), although adjustment for covariates attenuated this association. Conclusions: Psychological distress was a predictor of cancer mortality, especially in lung cancer. The presence of participants with cancer history in community-based cohorts may overestimate the association between psychological distress and subsequent cancer mortality. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Geographic spreading of lung cancer in Azerbaijan,"Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. The impact of geographic as well as of exogenous factor and factors of risk, life style and environment play an important role in etiology of lung cancer. Geographic spread of lung cancer data in literature is fragmentary. The limited existing literature does not report a consistent story of geographic variation in Azerbaijan for the incidence associated with lung cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of geographic variation on spread of lung cancer in Azerbaijan. Frequency of lung cancer in various regions of Azerbaijan; different histological types, sex, age and particular risk factors were investigated. It was revealed that epidermoid cancer was the most common histological type in all regions. The highest rate of epidermoid cancer 230 (55.56%) was revealed in industrial regions and industrial cities (Baku and Sumgait). The lowest rate of lung cancer was found in mountain region 12 (3.76%). Smoking and drinking alcohol increases risk of epidermoid cancer (41.2% of patients smoke and drink alcohol). The highest morbidity (13.55 per 100,000 population) and mortality (0.11) rates from lung cancer were observed in industrial regions. Analyses revealed that different endogenous and exogenous factors are associated with lung cancer.","['Soltanov, A.A.']",
"Prognostic factors for survival in extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC): The importance of smoking history, socioeconomic and marital statuses, and ethnicity","BACKGROUND: We investigated whether independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer such as ethnicity, smoking history, socioeconomic, and marital statuses are also applicable to extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ED-SCLC). METHODS: SCLC patients diagnosed from 1991 to 2005 from 3 Southern California counties were identified. Prognostic factors for ED-SCLC patients were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Of the 4782 SCLC patients analyzed, only 2.5% of the patients were never-smokers and 71.7% of patients presented with ED-SCLC. By multivariate analysis, a positive smoking status was a statistically significant poor prognostic factor for OS in ED-SCLC patients (versus never-smoker; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.310; p = 0.0125), in addition low socioeconomic status (SES) (from the lowest to the highest SES score; ptrend = 0.0128) and being unmarried (versus married; HR = 1.179; p < 0.0001). Asian ethnicity was a favorable prognostic factor in ED-SCLC (versus Caucasian; HR = 0.785; p = 0.0076). Female gender was another independent favorable prognostic factor (versus male; HR = 0.823; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: A positive history of smoking, low SES, and being unmarried are independent unfavorable prognostic factors for OS in ED-SCLC while Asian ethnicity and female gender are independent favorable prognostic factors for OS in ED-SCLC by multivariate analysis. © 2008 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.","['Ou, S.-H.I.', 'Ziogas, A.', 'Zell, J.A.']",10.1097/JTO.0b013e31819140fb
"Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2005, featuring trends in lung cancer, tobacco use, and tobacco control","Background: The American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to provide updated information on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. This year's report includes trends in lung cancer incidence and death rates, tobacco use, and tobacco control by state of residence. Methods: Information on invasive cancers was obtained from the NCI, CDC, and NAACCR and information on mortality from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percentage changes in the age-standardized incidence and death rates (2000 US population standard) for all cancers combined and for the top 15 cancers were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term (1975-2005) trends and by least squares linear regression of short-term (1996-2005) trends. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Both incidence and death rates from all cancers combined decreased statistically significantly (P < .05) in men and women overall and in most racial and ethnic populations. These decreases were driven largely by declines in both incidence and death rates for the three most common cancers in men (lung, colorectum, and prostate) and for two of the three leading cancers in women (breast and colorectum), combined with a leveling off of lung cancer death rates in women. Although the national trend in female lung cancer death rates has stabilized since 2003, after increasing for several decades, there is prominent state and regional variation. Lung cancer incidence and/or death rates among women increased in 18 states, 16 of them in the South or Midwest, where, on average, the prevalence of smoking was higher and the annual percentage decrease in current smoking among adult women was lower than in the West and Northeast. California was the only state with decreasing lung cancer incidence and death rates in women. Conclusions: Although the decrease in overall cancer incidence and death rates is encouraging, large state and regional differences in lung cancer trends among women underscore the need to maintain and strengthen many state tobacco control programs. © 2008 The Author(s).","['Jemal, A.', 'Thun, M.J.', 'Ries, L.A.G.', 'Howe, H.L.', 'Weir, H.K.', 'Center, M.M.', 'Ward, E.', 'Wu, X.-C.', 'Eheman, C.', 'Anderson, R.', 'Ajani, U.A.', 'Kohler, B.', 'Edwards, B.K.']",10.1093/jnci/djn389
Interruptions of once-daily thoracic radiotherapy do not correlate with outcomes in limited stage small cell lung cancer: Analysis of CALGB phase III trial 9235,"Purpose: Retrospective data suggests prolonging the time to complete thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) may negatively impact tumor control and survival in limited stage small cell lung cancer (LSCLC). We examined the association between TRT duration and outcomes on a prospective phase III study. Material and methods: This review included 267 patients who received protocol TRT on a phase III CALGB LSCLC study assessing the addition of tamoxifen to standard chemo-radiotherapy. TRT, to a planned dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions, was initiated with the fourth chemotherapy cycle. TRT interruptions were mandated for hematologic toxicity (granulocytes < 1000/mm3 or platelets < 75,000/mm3) and esophageal toxicity (dysphagia necessitating intravenous hydration). Results: TRT interruptions ≥3 days occurred in 115 patients (43%), most frequently during the 4th week of TRT, and did not differ between treatment arms. Hematologic toxicity and esophageal toxicity were the most frequent indications for interrupting TRT. Variables including advanced age (>70 years), gender, race, or radiotherapy treatment volume did not predict for TRT interruptions. Overall survival (OS) and local tumor control did not correlate with the administration of TRT interruptions or with TRT duration. Conclusion: Toxicity mandated interruptions of conventional dose, once-daily, TRT may not adversely affect outcomes for patients receiving TRT concurrent with chemotherapy (cycle 4) for LSCLC. The implications for accelerated or high dose TRT regimens are not clear. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Lung cancer occurrence in never-smokers: An analysis of 13 cohorts and 22 cancer registry studies,"Background: Better information on lung cancer occurrence in lifelong nonsmokers is needed to understand gender and racial disparities and to examine how factors other than active smoking influence risk in different time periods and geographic regions. Methods and Findings: We pooled information on lung cancer incidence and/or death rates among self-reported never-smokers from 13 large cohort studies, representing over 630,000 and 1.8 million persons for incidence and mortality, respectively. We also abstracted population-based data for women from 22 cancer registries and ten countries in time periods and geographic regions where few women smoked. Our main findings were: (1) Men had higher death rates from lung cancer than women in all age and racial groups studied; (2) male and female incidence rates were similar when standardized across all ages 40+ y, albeit with some variation by age; (3) African Americans and Asians living in Korea and Japan (but not in the US) had higher death rates from lung cancer than individuals of European descent; (4) no temporal trends were seen when comparing incidence and death rates among US women age 40-69 y during the 1930s to contemporary populations where few women smoke, or in temporal comparisons of never-smokers in two large American Cancer Society cohorts from 1959 to 2004; and (5) lung cancer incidence rates were higher and more variable among women in East Asia than in other geographic areas with low female smoking. Conclusions: These comprehensive analyses support claims that the death rate from lung cancer among never-smokers is higher in men than in women, and in African Americans and Asians residing in Asia than in individuals of European descent, but contradict assertions that risk is increasing or that women have a higher incidence rate than men.

"Secular trends in mortality from common cancers in the United States by educational attainment, 1993-2001","Background: Death rates for the four major cancer sites (lung, breast, prostate, and colon and rectum) have declined steadily in the United States among persons aged 25-64 years since the early 1990s. We used national data to examine these trends in relation to educational attainment. Methods: We calculated age-standardized death rates for each of the four cancers by level of education among 25- to 64-year-old non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black men and women for 1993 through 2001 using data on approximately 86% of US deaths from the National Center for Health Statistics, education level as recorded on the death certificate, and population data from the US Bureau of Census Current Population Survey. Annual percent changes in age-adjusted death rates were estimated using weighted log-linear regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Death rates for each cancer decreased statistically significantly from 1993 to 2001 in people with at least 16 years of education in every sex and race stratum except lung cancer in black women, for whom death rates were stable. For example, colorectal cancer death rates among white men, black men, white women, and black women with at least 16 years of education decreased by 2.4% (P <. 001), 4.8% (P =. 011), 3.0% (P <. 001), and 2.6% (P =. 030) annually, respectively. By contrast, among people with less than 12 years of education, a statistically significant decrease in death rates from 1993 through 2001 was seen only for breast cancer in white women (1.4% per year; P =. 029). Death rates among persons with less than 12 years of education over the same time interval increased for lung cancer in white women (2.4% per year; P <. 001) and for colon cancer in black men (2.7% per year; P <. 001) and were stable for the remaining race/sex/site strata. Temporal trends generally followed an educational gradient in which the slopes of the decreases in death rate became steeper with higher educational attainment. Conclusion: The recent declines in death rates from major cancers in the United States mainly reflect declines in more highly educated individuals. © 2008 The Author(s).","['Kinsey, T.', 'Jemal, A.', 'Liff, J.', 'Ward, E.', 'Thun, M.']",10.1093/jnci/djn207
"Underuse of Surgical Resection for Localized, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Among Whites and African Americans in South Carolina","Background: Early studies using Medicare data reported racial disparities in surgical treatment of localized, non-small cell lung cancer. We analyzed the independent effect of race on use of surgical resection in a recent, population-based sample of patients with localized non-small cell lung cancer, controlling for comorbidity and socioeconomic status. Methods: All cases of localized non-small cell lung cancer reported to our state Cancer Registry between 1996 and 2002 were identified and linked to the Inpatient/Outpatient Surgery Files and 2000 Census. Comorbidity (Romano-Charlson index) was calculated using administrative data codes. Educational level and income were estimated using census data. Characteristics of white and African American patients were compared using χ2 tests. Odds ratios of resection and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using logistic regression. Results: We identified 2,506 white and 550 African American patients. African Americans were more likely to be younger, male, not married, less educated, poor, and uninsured or covered by Medicaid (all p < 0.0001), and to reside in rural communities (p = 0.0005). Use of surgical resection across races was lower than previously reported, and African Americans were significantly less likely to undergo surgery compared with whites (44.7% versus 63.4%; p < 0.0001). Even after controlling for sociodemographics, comorbidity, and tumor factors, the adjusted odds ratio for resection for African Americans was 0.43 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.55). Conclusions: Underuse of surgical resection for localized, non-small cell lung cancer is a persistent problem, particularly among African Americans. Further studies are urgently needed to identify the patient-, physician-, and health system-related factors underlying these observations and optimize resection rates for non-small cell lung cancer. © 2008 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.","['Esnaola, N.F.', 'Gebregziabher, M.', 'Knott, K.', 'Finney, C.', 'Silvestri, G.A.', 'Reed, C.E.', 'Ford, M.E.']",10.1016/j.athoracsur.2008.02.072
Impact of race on outcomes of patients with non-small cell lung cancer,"Objective:: Examination of factors that may contribute to racial disparity among those with lung cancer has been thwarted by heterogeneous treatment and staging strategies, limited national registry and socioeconomic and follow-up data. This study examines a decades worth of data to better elucidate these factors in a cohort staged or treated using homogeneous algorithms. Methods:: A nested case-control study of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). White patients were matched 4:1 to African American patients on age, gender, comorbidities, performance status, and stage. All patients underwent clinical and pathologic staging by one physician using similar staged-based treatment algorithms. Socioeconomic status was assessed by annual income per capita, insurance status, and education level. The primary outcome was survival rate. Results:: Among the 930 patients in this series, African Americans were more likely to be smokers (p < 0.001), have a lower per-capita annual income (p = 0.016), greater delay to treatment (p = 0.023), and less likely to agree to neo-adjuvant therapy (p < 0.001). Whites had better 5-year overall survival than African Americans for stage I (84% versus 78%, p = 0.037), stage II (52% versus 44%, p = 0.041), and stage III (32% versus 20%, p = 0.008) NSCLC. However, this survival advantage disappeared for earlier stages of NSCLC (I and II) when adjusted for socioeconomic status and smoking status. The survival advantage for stage IIIa was lost when adjusted for neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. African American men had the worst survival of all subgroups independent of socioeconomic status. Conclusions:: Given uniform staging, treatment, and socioeconomic status the overall survival rates for African American and White patients with NSLC are similar.

"A comparison of survival and disease-specific survival in surgically resected, lymph node-positive bronchioloalveolar carcinoma versus nonsmall cell lung cancer: Implications for adjuvant therapy","BACKGROUND. The objective of this study was to assess whether disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) differed among patients who had N1 and N2 bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) compared with patients who had non-BAC nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database from 1992 to 2002 contained 684 patients with BAC and 9809 patients with non-BAC NSCLC who had N1/N2 tumors and who underwent a definitive surgical procedure. OS and DSS rates were compared according to potential prognostic factors, including the use of a matched-pair analysis. RESULTS. The BAC patients with either pathologic N1 or N2 lymph node status were significantly more likely to be women, and nonblack/nonwhite race, but significantly less likely to have poorly differentiated or undifferentiated tumors than patients with non-BAC cancers with comparable lymph node status. The median follow-up of all patients was 29 months. There was a significant difference in DSS between patients with N2 BAC and non-BAC cancers, but not for patients with N1 disease. There was a nonsignificant trend toward longer OS for patients with N2 BAC compared with non-BAC cancers. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with lymph node-positive BAC had distinctly different patient and tumor characteristics than patients with lymph node-positive non-BAC NSCLC. Because DSS appears to be better for patients with N2 BAC, they may not benefit as much from adjuvant therapy as patients with non-BAC NSCLC. © 2008 American Cancer Society.","['Varlotto, J.M.', 'Flickinger, J.C.', 'Recht, A.', 'Nikolov, M.C.', 'DeCamp, M.M.']",10.1002/cncr.23289
Cancer incidence and mortality patterns among specific Asian and Pacific Islander populations in the U.S.,"Objectives: We report cancer incidence, mortality, and stage distributions among Asians and Pacific Islanders (API) residing in the U.S. and note health disparities, using the cancer experience of the non-Hispanic white population as the referent group. New databases added to publicly available SEER*Stat software will enable public health researchers to further investigate cancer patterns among API groups. Methods: Cancer diagnoses among API groups occurring from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2002 were included from 14 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program state and regional population-based cancer registries covering 54% of the U.S. API population. Cancer deaths were included from the seven states that report death information for detailed API groups and which cover over 68% of the total U.S. API population. Using detailed racial/ethnic population data from the 2000 decennial census, we produced incidence rates centered on the census year for Asian Indians/Pakistanis, Chinese, Filipinos, Guamanians, Native Hawaiians, Japanese, Kampucheans, Koreans, Laotians, Samoans, Tongans, and Vietnamese. State vital records offices do not report API deaths separately for Kampucheans, Laotians, Pakistanis, and Tongans, so mortality rates were analyzed only for the remaining API groups. Results: Overall cancer incidence rates for the API groups tended be lower than overall rates for non-Hispanic whites, with the exception of Native Hawaiian women (All cancers rate = 488.5 per 100,000 vs. 448.5 for non-Hispanic white women). Among the API groups, overall cancer incidence and death rates were highest for Native Hawaiian and Samoan men and women due to high rates for cancers of the prostate, lung, and colorectum among Native Hawaiian men; cancers of the prostate, lung, liver, and stomach among Samoan men; and cancers of the breast and lung among Native Hawaiian and Samoan women. Incidence and death rates for cancers of the liver, stomach, and nasopharynx were notably high in several of the API groups and exceeded rates generally seen for non-Hispanic white men and women. Incidence rates were lowest among Asian Indian/Pakistani and Guamanian men and women and Kampuchean women. Asian Indian and Guamanian men and women also had the lowest cancer death rates. Selected API groups had less favorable distributions of stage at diagnosis for certain cancers than non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: Possible disparities in cancer incidence or mortality between specific API groups in our study and non-Hispanic whites (referent group) were identified for several cancers. Unfavorable patterns of stage at diagnosis for cancers of the colon and rectum, breast, cervix uteri, and prostate suggest a need for cancer control interventions in selected groups. The observed variation in cancer patterns among API groups indicates the importance of monitoring these groups separately, as these patterns may provide etiologic clues that could be investigated by analytic epidemiological studies. © 2007 The Author(s).","['Miller, B.A.', 'Chu, K.C.', 'Hankey, B.F.', 'Ries, L.A.G.']",10.1007/s10552-007-9088-3
"Poor survival for US Pacific Islander cancer patients: Evidence from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results database: 1991 to 2004","Purpose: Although racial and ethnic differences in cancer survival in the United States have been studied extensively, little is known about cancer survival in US Pacific Islanders (PIs), a fast-growing and economically disadvantaged minority group. Methods: Using data from the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries, we compared cause-specific and all-cause survival for female breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, stomach and liver cancer for Native Hawaiians, Samoans, other PIs (including Tongans, Guamanians, and others), African Americans, and Native Americans with non-Hispanic whites using Cox proportional hazards models. Separate models were fitted adjusting for demographic factors only and demographic and disease severity variables. Results: Among all groups, Samoans were the most likely to present with advanced disease and had the worst cause-specific survival for all sites considered. Samoans had particularly poor results (adjusted for demographic variables only) for female breast (relative risk [RR] = 3.05; 95% CI, 2.31 to 4.02), colorectal (RR = 1.82; 95% CI, 1.37 to 2.41) and prostate (RR = 4.82; 95% CI, 3.38 to 6.88) cancers. Native Hawaiians and other PIs also had significantly worse cause-specific survival than did non-Hispanic whites for most sites, but generally had better survival than African Americans or Native Americans. Conclusion: Much of the survival disadvantage for PI groups appears to be a result of late diagnosis, and thus targeted interventions have much potential to reduce cancer mortality in this group. More research is needed to find explanations for the particularly poor cancer survival for Samoans in the United States. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.","['Goggins, W.B.', 'Wong, G.K.C.']",10.1200/JCO.2007.13.8271
Death anxiety and cancer-related stigma: A terror management analysis,"In a study designed to examine correlates of cancer-related stigma, 405 college students were assigned randomly to listen to an audiotaped interview in which the target's cancer type and smoking status were manipulated. In the lung cancer conditions, target gender also was manipulated. Social distance and emotional responses differed according to participant gender, death anxiety, and target cancer type. Participant gender and target characteristics also were associated with perceptions of the target's character. Findings partially support terror management theory and suggest that death attitudes, gender norms, and diagnostic status influence social distancing from individuals with cancer.","['Mosher, C.E.', 'Danoff-Burg, S.']",10.1080/07481180701603360
Measures of racial/ethnic health disparities in cancer mortality rates and the influence of socioeconomic status,"Objectives: In the 1990s, U.S. cancer mortality rates declined due to reductions in tobacco use among men and beneficial cancer interventions, such as mammography and Pap smears. We examined the cancer rates by racial/ethnic group, socioeconomic status and time period to identify disparities underlying the overall mortality trend. Methods: We examined racial/ethnic disparities by measuring excess cancer burden [rate ratio (RR) and ratio differences (RD)] and trends in their cancer rates for nine cancer sites. The trend (T) is calculated as a ratio of the average annual cancer mortality rate for 1995-2000 relative to the rate for 1990-1994 for three levels of poverty (counties with <10% living below the poverty level, 10%-<20% and >20%) for the major racial/ethnic populations. We also compared the trend for each racial/ethnic SES group to the trend for lowest SES white group (TD). Results: Blacks have RR disparities relative to whites for each cancer site examined, except for female lung cancer, while the other minorities had RR disparities for cervical cancer (RR>1). There are increases in RR disparities from 1990-1994 to 1995-2000 (RD>0) for colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer for each racial/ethnic minority. Whites and blacks had declining trends for every SES group (T<1) and positive high SES gradients (the highest SES group had the best trend and the lowest SES group had the worst trend) at each cancer site, except female lung cancer (T>1). In contrast, American Indians/Alaska natives, Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders had increasing trends for some of their cancer sites, and their trends did not have the SES gradients. Conclusions: Increases in racial/ethnic disparities (RD>0) for colorectal, breast and prostate cancer were largest in the lowest SES groups. At some cancer sites, the highest SES group for minorities had worse trend results than the trends for the lowest SES white group (TD>0).","['Chu, K.C.', 'Miller, B.A.', 'Springfield, S.A.']",
Cancer mortality in the United States by education level and race,"Background: Although both race and socioeconomic status are well known to influence mortality patterns in the United States, few studies have examined the simultaneous influence of these factors on cancer incidence and mortality. We examined relationships among race, education level, and mortality from cancers of the lung, breast, prostate, colon and rectum, and all sites combined in contemporary US vital statistics. Methods: Age-adjusted cancer death rates (with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were calculated for 137708 deaths among 119376196 individuals aged 25-64 years, using race and education information from death certificates and population denominator data from the US Bureau of the Census, for 47 states and Washington, DC, in 2001. Relative risk (RR) estimates were used to compare cancer death rates in persons with 12 or fewer years of education with those in persons with more than 12 years of education. Results: Educational attainment was strongly and inversely associated with mortality from all cancers combined in black and white men and in white women. The all-cancer death rates were nearly identical for black men and white men with 0-8 years of education (224.2 and 223.6 per 100000, respectively). The estimated relative risk for all-cancer mortality comparing the three lowest (≤12 years) with the three highest (>12 years) education categories was 2.38 (95% CI = 2.33 to 2.43) for black men, 2.24 (95% CI = 2.23 to 2.26) for white men, 1.43 (95% CI = 1.41 to 1.46) for black women, and 1.76 (95% CI = 1.75 to 1.78) for white women. For both men and women, the magnitude of the relative risks comparing the three lowest educational levels with the three highest within each race for all cancers combined and for lung and colorectal cancers was higher than the magnitude of the relative risks associated with race within each level of education, whereas for breast and prostate cancer the magnitude of the relative risks associated with race was higher than the magnitude of the relative risks associated with level of education within each racial group. Among the most important and novel findings were that black men who completed 12 or fewer years of education had a prostate cancer death rate that was more than double that of black men with more schooling (10.5 versus 4.8 per 100000 men; RR = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.82 to 2.58) and that, in contrast with studies of mortality rates in earlier time periods, breast cancer mortality rates were higher among women with less education than among women with more education (37.0 and 31.1 per 100000, respectively, for black women and 25.2 versus 18.6 per 100000, respectively, for white women). Conclusion: Cancer death rates vary considerably by level of education. Identifying groups at high risk of death from cancer by level of education as well as by race may be useful in targeting interventions and tracking cancer disparities. © 2007 The Author(s).","['Albano, J.D.', 'Ward, E.', 'Jemal, A.', 'Anderson, R.', 'Cokkinides, V.E.', 'Murray, T.', 'Henley, J.', 'Liff, J.', 'Thun, M.J.']",10.1093/jnci/djm127
"National survey of non-small cell lung cancer in the United States: Epidemiology, pathology and patterns of care","Purpose: To determine the epidemiology, pathology and patterns of care for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the United States. Methods: In 2001 the National Cancer Data Base, under direction of the American College of Surgeons, conducted a patient care evaluation study in 719 hospitals. We collected information on patient demographics and histories, diagnostic and staging methods, pathology, and initial treatment. Results: Information on 40,909 patients was obtained; 93% were smokers. Slightly more than half were older than 70 years; 58.5% were male and 35% had adenocarcinoma. Comorbid conditions were present in 71.8% and 22% had a prior malignancy. A chest CT scan was performed in 92% of patients and PET scans in 19.3%. Mediastinoscopy was performed in 20.3%. 67.2% of patients had Stage III or IV disease. More of the Hispanic, Asian or Black patients than White had Stage IV disease (p < 0.01). Treatment was multimodality in a little over 30% of patients. Surgery alone was primarily utilized for patients in Stage I or II. Choice of treatment correlated more with stage and age than comorbidities. Conclusion: Our results substantiated the pattern of increasing proportions of women with NSCLC and the increasing frequency of adenocarcinoma. Most patients presented with Stage III or IV disease. Ethnic minorities were more likely to present in late stage disease than Whites. Treatment strategies depended more on stage and age than comorbid burden. Older patients were less likely to receive surgery and more likely to be treated with radiation only or have no treatment. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Contribution of specific causes of death to educational differences in mortality,"This article analyses educational inequalities in mortality and examines the role of different causes of death for these differences. Data are constructed by linkages of Norwegian administrative registers. The analysed sample consists of practically all men and women living in Norway in 1993 and aged 25-66 years (N = 2.2 millions). Deaths 1994-2003, classified into 18 groups of causes, were analysed by age-adjusted logistic regression (outcome variable died/survived 1994-2003). Age-adjusted estimations of how many deaths could potentially be avoided if mortality risk for all educational levels had been equal to the risk among higher university educated (12% of the sample) were made. During 1994-2003, 104,000 of the sample died (men 5.8%, women 3.5%). Odds ratios (ORs) for all deaths increased for each descending level of education (ORs basic education versus higher university 2.6/2.2 for men/women). Educational differences were very large for substance abuse deaths and well above average for chronic lung disease and alcohol-related deaths. ORs were also clearly above average for lung cancer deaths (both sexes) and ischaemic heart disease deaths (only women). Educational differences were relatively small or insignificant for other cancer categories. Among women, no educational inequalities were found for colorectal cancer, suicide, breast cancer, and traffic accidents. If death risk in lower educational levels had been equal to the observed death risk in higher university education, 43% (men) and 39% (women) of the actually occurring deaths 1994-2003 would have been avoided. More than half of these potentially avoided deaths occurred among those with basic education (25% of the sample). Cardiovascular diseases represented 38% (men) and 35% (women) of this hypothetical potential for avoided deaths. Also lung cancer (12% both sexes) and chronic lung disease (6% men, 11% women) contributed strongly to the number of excess deaths. Findings are interesting in view of current discussions about strategies for reducing socioeconomic inequalities in health.","['Elstad, J.I.', 'Hofoss, D.', 'Dahl, E.']",
Differences in the therapeutic strategies for lung cancer between Europe/United States and Japan,"Lung cancer is a leading cause of malignancy-related death worldwide. Recently, therapeutic strategies for lung cancer have dramatically progressed, and attempts have been made to standardize the therapy for lung cancer. Because the disease prevalence and the susceptibility to the drugs differ with the circumstances, such as lifestyle, and genetic background, and ethnicity, the standard therapeutic strategies for lung cancer may differ with the individual country or region. Actually, the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, is well known to be significantly effective for oriental people, including Japanese, female, adenocarcinoma and never-smoker, suggesting an inherited difference. Here we describe not only the standard therapeutic strategies but also the difference in therapeutic strategies for lung cancer between Europe/United States and Japan.","['Hanibuchi, M.', 'Yano, S.', 'Tomimoto, H.', 'Sone, S.']",
Lung cancer in never smokers: A review,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although tobacco smoking accounts for the majority of lung cancer, approximately 10% of patients with lung cancer in the United States are lifelong never smokers. Lung cancer in the never smokers (LCINS) affects women disproportionately more often than men. Only limited data are available on the etiopathogenesis, molecular abnormalities, and prognosis of LCINS. Several etiologic factors have been proposed for the development of LCINS, including exposure to radon, cooking fumes, asbestos, heavy metals, and environmental tobacco smoke, human papillomavirus infection, and inherited genetic susceptibility. However, the relative significance of these individual factors among different ethnic populations in the development of LCINS has not been well-characterized. Adenocarcinoma is the predominant histologic subtype reported with LCINS. Striking differences in response rates and outcomes are seen when patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are lifelong never smokers are treated with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) inhibitors such as gefitinib or erlotinib compared with the outcomes with these agents in patients with tobacco-associated lung cancer. Interestingly, the activating mutations in the EGFR-TK inhibitors have been reported significantly more frequently in LCINS than in patients with tobacco-related NSCLC. This review will summarize available data on the epidemiology, risk factors, molecular genetics, management options, and outcomes of LCINS. © 2007 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.","['Subramanian, J.', 'Govindan, R.']",10.1200/JCO.2006.06.8015
"Women with pathologic stage I, II, and III non-small cell lung cancer have better survival than men","Objective: Bronchogenic malignancy is the number one cause of cancer deaths in both men and women worldwide. National registry-based studies have shown gender disparity in clinicopathologic characteristics and in survival. This study evaluates the risk factors and trends of lung cancer between genders. Methods: A prospective cohort of consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were carefully clinically (all underwent dedicated positron emission tomography scans) and pathologically staged with stage I, II, or III disease underwent homogenous treatment algorithms and were followed up over a period of 7 years. Primary outcomes were 5-year survival and response to neoadjuvant therapy. Results: There were 1,085 patients (671 men and 414 women). Groups were similar for race, pulmonary function, smoking history, comorbidities, neoadjuvant therapy, histology, and resection rates. Women were younger (p = 0.014), had a higher incidence of adenocarcinoma (p = 0.01), and presented at an earlier pathologic stage (p = 0.01) than men. The overall age-adjusted and stage-adjusted 5-year survival rate favored women (60% vs 50%, respectively; p < 0.001). Women had better stage-specific 5-year survival rates (stage I disease, 69% vs 64%, respectively [p = 0.034]; stage II disease, 60% vs 50%, respectively [p = 0.042]; and stage III disease, 46% vs 37%, respectively [p = 0.024]). Women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone (n = 76) were more likely to be a complete or partial responder than men (n = 142; p = 0.025). Conclusions: Despite uniform staging and treatment, the 5-year survival rate of women with stage I to III NSCLC was better than men overall and at each stage. Women are more likely to have adenocarcinoma, to present with earlier stage disease, and to be younger. Interestingly, women respond better to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","['Cerfolio, R.J.', 'Bryant, A.S.', 'Scott, E.', 'Sharma, M.', 'Robert, F.', 'Spencer, S.A.', 'Garver, R.I.']",10.1378/chest.130.6.1796
The contribution of specific causes of death to sex differences in mortality,"Objective. Men have higher mortality rates than women for most causes of death. This study was conducted to determine the contribution of specific causes of death to the sex difference in years of potential life lost (YPLL). Methods. The authors examined data from the National Health Interview Survey with linked mortality data through 1997. Using survival analysis estimates, a stochastic simulation model to simulate death events for cohorts of white, African American, and Latino adults was created. Results. YPLL from all causes were greater among men than women. Homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and suicide accounted for 33% of YPLL sex difference among whites, 36% among African Americans, and 52% among Latinos. For all three racial/ethnic groups, cardiovascular disease (principally ischemic heart disease) was the second largest contributor to the sex difference in YPLL (29% among whites, 23% among African Americans, and 25% among Latinos). Lung cancer was also important among whites and African Americans, accounting for 15% and 17% of the sex difference in YPLL from all causes, respectively. Conclusions. Ischemic heart disease, lung cancer, and traumatic deaths account for as much as three-quarters of the excess YPLL among men, suggesting that a few modifiable behaviors such as the use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs and violence may account for much of the shorter life expectancy among men. ©2006 Association of Schools of Public Health.","['Wong, M.D.', 'Chung, A.K.', 'Boscardin, W.J.', 'Li, M.', 'Hsieh, H.-J.', 'Ettner, S.L.', 'Shapiro, M.F.']",10.1177/003335490612100615
Lung cancer in women,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer in both men and women; however, there are some clear gender-based differences. As the incidence of lung cancer is declining in men, the incidence of lung cancer is increasing in women. Women are more likely than men to have adenocarcinoma, a histologic subtype that correlates with worsened prognosis, but women have improved survival compared with men. Genetic predisposition and the presence of estrogen receptors in lung cancer cells may predispose women to developing lung cancer.

Sleep-wake disturbances and quality of life in patients with advanced lung cancer.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To examine the scope and severity of subjective sleep-wake disturbances in patients with lung cancer and compare them to a group of healthy adults who were similar in age, gender, and race, and to examine the impact of sleep-wake disturbances on measures of health-related quality of life (QOL). DESIGN: Descriptive, comparative. SETTING: University-based and private urban ambulatory care clinics. SAMPLE: 43 patients with advanced non-small cell or small cell lung cancer and 36 healthy adults. All participants were cognitively intact, and none had any known neurologic disorder, polysomnographically diagnosed sleep disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, or cerebral metastasis. METHODS: Questionnaires, interview, and medical record review. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: Nocturnal sleep (quality, quantity, and disturbance), daytime sleepiness, and health-related QOL (physical, mental). FINDINGS: Patients with lung cancer had poor perceived nocturnal sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness that differed significantly from the comparison group. Sleep disturbances in the group with lung cancer were characterized by breathing difficulty, cough, nocturia, and frequent awakenings. Sleep-wake disturbances were significantly associated with poorer health-related QOL after controlling for group. Excessive daytime sleepiness was associated most often with decreases in mental health, whereas poor nocturnal sleep was associated most often with decreases in physical health. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that sleep-wake disturbances are common in patients with lung cancer and that the disturbances are significantly associated with health-related QOL. Patients with lung cancer may be at risk for sleep-disordered breathing. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: The magnitude of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness identified in this study reinforces the importance of ongoing screening and effective intervention for sleep-wake disturbances in patients with lung cancer.","['Vena, C.', 'Parker, K.', 'Allen, R.', 'Bliwise, D.', 'Jain, S.', 'Kimble, L.']",
Survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who opted out of cancer-specific therapy,"In Malaysia, many patients opted out of cancer-specific treatment for various reasons. This study was undertaken to investigate the survival rate of patients with stages I to III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who opted out of treatment, compared with those who accepted treatment. Case records of 119 patients diagnosed with NSCLC between 1996 and 2003 in two urban-based hospitals were retrospectively examined. Survival status was ascertained from follow-up medical clinic records or telephone contact with patients or their next-of-kin. Median (25-75% IQR) survival rate for 79 patients who accepted and 22 patients who opted out of treatment, were 8.6 (16.0-3.7) and 2.2 (3.5-0.8) months respectively [log rank p<0.001, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis]. Except for proportionately more patients with large cell carcinoma who declined treatment, there was no significant difference between the two groups in relation with age, gender, ethnicity, tumour stage, and time delays between symptom onset and treatment or decision-to-treat. We concluded that there was a small but significant survival benefit in accepting cancer-specific treatment. The findings imply that there is no effective alternative therapy to cancer-specific treatment in improving survival.

"Tobacco smoke overload and ethnic, state, gender, and temporal cancer mortality disparities in Asian-Americans and Pacific Islander-Americans","Background.: Asians and Pacific Islanders (APIs) are important populations nationally and globally. So we assessed cumulative tobacco smoke overexposure (smoke overload)/cancer mortality associations across states, ethnicities, years, and genders among API-Americans. Methods.: Death rates were adjusted to the 2000 United States age standard, lung cancer death rates used as a smoke overload bio-index, and lung/non-lung cancer death rate linear regressions run. Cancer death rate smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) are equal to 1 - estimated unexposed rate/observed rate. Results.: The two lowest smoke overload and non-lung cancer death rates were in South Asian (Indo)-Californian females and males. The highest were in Korean-Californian males. Non-lung cancer death rates were tightly and steeply associated with smoke overload across ethnicity, state, year, or gender. Cancer death rate smoking-attributable fractions ranged from 0 in female and 6% in male Indo-Californians, to 39% in female and 57% in male API-Americans in 2002, to 71% in Korean-Californian and 69% in API Hawaiian males. Discussion.: Many API American cancer death rate disparities across genders, ethnicities, states, or years can be explained by smoke overload disparities. Tobacco control may greatly reduce cancer death rates and disparities among API-Americans and, likely, others. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Lung cancer death rates in lifelong nonsmokers,"Background: Few studies have directly measured the age-, sex-, and race-specific risks of lung cancer incidence and mortality among never tobacco smokers. Such data are needed to quantify the risks associated with smoking and to understand racial and sex disparities and temporal trends that are due to factors other than active smoking. Methods: We measured age-, sex-, and race-specific rates (per 100 000 person-years at risk) of death from lung cancer among more than 940 000 adults who reported no history of smoking at enrollment in either of two large American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study cohorts during 1959-1972 (CPS-I) and 1982-2000 (CPS-II). We compared lung cancer death rates between men and women and between African Americans and whites and analyzed temporal trends in lung cancer death rates among never smokers across the two studies by using directly age-standardized rates as well as Poisson and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: The age-standardized lung cancer death rates among never-smoking men and women in CPS-II were 17.1 and 14.7 per 100 000 person-years, respectively. Men who had never smoked had higher age-standardized lung cancer death rates than women in both studies (CPS-I: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.28 to 1.79; CPS-II: HR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.36). The rate was higher among African American women than white women in CPS-II (HR = 1.43, CI = 1.11 to 1.85). A small temporal increase (CPS-II versus CPS-I) in lung cancer mortality was seen for white women (HR = 1.25, CI = 1.12 to 1.41) and African American women (HR = 1.22, CI = 0.64 to 2.33), but not for white men (HR = 0.89, CI = 0.74 to 1.08). Among white and African American women combined, the temporal increase was statistically significant only among those aged 70-84 years (P < .001). Conclusions: Contrary to clinical perception, the lung cancer death rate is not higher in female than in male never smokers and shows little evidence of having increased over time in the absence of smoking. Factors that affect the interpretation of lung cancer trends are discussed. Our novel finding that lung cancer mortality is higher among African American than white women never smokers should be confirmed in other studies. © Copyright 2006 Oxford University Press.","['Thun, M.J.', 'Henley, S.J.', 'Burns, D.', 'Jemal, A.', 'Shanks, T.G.', 'Calle, E.E.']",10.1093/jnci/djj187
"Cancer statistics, 2006","Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Incidence and death rates are age-standardized to the 2000 US standard million population. A total of 1,399,790 new cancer cases and 564,830 deaths from cancer are expected in the United States in 2006. When deaths are aggregated by age, cancer has surpassed heart disease as the leading cause of death for those younger than age 85 since 1999. Delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates stabilized in men from 1995 through 2002, but continued to increase by 0.3% per year from 1987 through 2002 in women. Between 2002 and 2003, the actual number of recorded cancer deaths decreased by 778 in men, but increased by 409 in women, resulting in a net decrease of 369, the first decrease in the total number of cancer deaths since national mortality record keeping was instituted in 1930. The death rate from all cancers combined has decreased by 1.5% per year since 1993 among men and by 0.8% per year since 1992 among women. The mortality rate has also continued to decrease for the three most common cancer sites in men (lung and bronchus, colon and rectum, and prostate) and for breast and colon and rectum cancers in women. Lung cancer mortality among women continues to increase slightly. In analyses by race and ethnicity, African American men and women have 40% and 18% higher death rates from all cancers combined than White men and women, respectively. Cancer incidence and death rates are lower in other racial and ethnic groups than in Whites and African Americans for all sites combined and for the four major cancer sites. However, these groups generally have higher rates for stomach, liver, and cervical cancers than Whites. Furthermore, minority populations are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage disease than are Whites. Progress in reducing the burden of suffering and death from cancer can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population. © American Cancer Society, Inc., 2006.","['Jemal, A.', 'Siegel, R.', 'Ward, E.', 'Murray, T.', 'Xu, J.', 'Smigal, C.', 'Thun, M.J.']",
Analysis of lung cancer death situation and potential life loss of residents in Xuzhou urban areas,"Background: Lung cancer keeps the first place in malignant tumor death all along. It is quite necessary to clarify the situation and tendency change of residents' lung cancer death for formulating prevention and cure strategy. Objective: To investigate the lung cancer death characte ristics, death trend and result out potential life loss of the residents in urban areas of Xuzhou. Design: A retrospective descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Center for Disease Prevention and Control of Xuzhou. Participants: Totally 3 890 cases died of lung cancer between 1990 and 2003 in the urban areas of Xuzhou city. Methods: Residents' lung cancer death characteristics and potential life span loss situation with parameters of crude death rate, standardized death rate, age specific death rate and potential life span loss and other indexes of the residents in the urban areas of Xuzhou city in 1990 and 2003 were described. Main outcome measures: 1 Crude death rate of lu ng cancer; 2 Potential life span loss; 3 Life lost rate. Results: 1 During 14 years period, 3 890 cases of lung cancer death happened which accounted for 27.43% of total cases of malignant tumor death; 2 year average death rate was 28.31/100 thousand, standardized death rate was 24.88/100 thousand, residents' potential life span loss caused by lung cancer death accounted for 24 230 people per year 3 life decreasing rate was 1.19/1 000, standardized life decreasing rate was 1.45/1 000, each case of lung cancer death resulted in potential life loss of 6.23 years; males' death rate was higher than females' (χ2=575.70,P < 0.01), the ratio of male to female was 2.31:1. Age specific death rate of male and female after 20 years of age increased in an exponential manner. Conclusion: Lung cancer is the most serious malignant tumor that threatens the life health of residents in urban areas of Xuzhou city; the potential life span loss caused by lung cancer is very big. The amount of carcinogenic substances exposed in environments is closely related to the occurrence of lung cancer; therefore, prevention and control of lung cancer should be performed actively.","['Zhao, G.-F.', 'Yu, J.-X.', 'An, X.-H.']",
New chemotherapeutic agents: Molecular targeted therapy for NSCLC,"Gefitinib (Iressa®) and erlotinib (Tarceva®), which are epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKl), have been used in treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several clinical trials have revealed important findings in the clinical therapeutic mechanism of EGFR-TKI. In Japan, gefitinib was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, for the first time in the world, in July 2002. A large number of patients with NSCLC have received gefitinib. High incidence and mortality due to interstitial lung disease (ILD) induced by gefitinib gave rise to public criticism of the early approval. A randomized phase III trial (BR21) of erlotinib compared with placebo in NSCLC patients with previous chemotherapy showed that erlotinib had a significant survival advantage. Various predictive factors of EGFR-TKIs were revealed by several clinical trials such as female gender, adenocarcinoma, non-smoker, Japanese ethnicity. It is very exciting that EGFR gene mutations are related with response to EGFR-TKIs. This finding is expected to open the door to individualized treatment. Preclinical and clinical studies of molecular targeted therapy are making rapid progress. Recently, a randomized controlled trial of gefitinib compared with placebo in second-line treatment for NSCLC failed to show a significant survival advantage of gefitinib. EGFR mutations were indicated to be reliable predictive factors of response and survival in patients with NSCLC. © 2005 The Japan Lung Cancer Society.","['Takeda, K.']",10.2482/haigan.45.793
Radiation therapy for the treatment of unresected stage I-II non-small cell lung cancer,"Study objectives: Radiotherapy is considered to be the standard treatment for patients with stage I or II non-small lung cancer who refuse surgery or who are not surgical candidates because of significant comorbidities. To determine whether radiotherapy benefits these patients, we compared the survival of those treated with radiation alone to those left untreated. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry, we identified all patients in whom histologically confirmed, stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer had been diagnosed between 1988 and 2001. Among these patients, 4,357 did not undergo surgical resection. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were compared among patients who received and who did not receive radiation therapy. We used Cox regression analysis to evaluate the effect of radiation on survival after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: The survival of patients with lung cancer who did not undergo resection and had been treated with radiation therapy was significantly better compared to the untreated patients (stage I cancer, p = 0.0001; stage II cancer, p = 0.001). The median survival time of patients with stage I disease who underwent radiotherapy was 21 months compared to 14 months for untreated patients. Stage II patients who received and did not receive radiation therapy had median survival times of 14 and 9 months, respectively. The survival of treated and untreated patients was not significantly different approximately 5 years after diagnosis (stage I disease, 15% vs 14%, respectively; stage II disease, 11% vs 10%, respectively). In multivariate analysis, radiation therapy was significantly associated with improved lung cancer survival after controlling for age, sex, race, and tumor histology. Conclusions: These results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with improved survival in patients with unresected stage I or II non-small cell lung cancer. The observed improvement in median survival time was only 5 to 7 months, and radiotherapy did not offer the possibility of a cure.","['Wisnivesky, J.P.', 'Bonomi, M.', 'Henschke, C.', 'Iannuzzi, M.', 'McGinn, T.']",10.1378/chest.128.3.1461
Gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer,"Gefitinib (Iressa™), an orally-active tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is the first approved molecular-targeted drug for the management of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Two Phase II trials (IDEAL [Iressa Dose Evaluation in Advanced Lung Cancer]-1 and -2), evaluated the efficacy of gefitinib in advanced NSCLC patients who received ≤ 2 (IDEAL1) or ≥ 2 (IDEAL2) previous chemotherapy regimens. The response rate and disease control rate in IDEAL1 and -2 was 18/12% and 54/42%, respectively. The median survival time and one-year survival rate in both studies were ∼ 7 months and 30%, respectively. As gefitinib has demonstrated antitumour activity and an acceptable tolerability profile not typically associated with cytotoxic adverse events, such as hematological toxicities, combinations with cytotoxic drugs have been evaluated. Disappointingly, in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced NSCLC, gefitinib 250 and 500 mg/day combined with platinum-based chemotherapy (gemcitabine/cisplatin or paclitaxel/carboplatin) did not produce prolonged survival, compared with chemotherapy alone in two large, randomised, placebo-controlled, multi-centre Phase III trials (INTACT [Iressa NSCLC Trial Assessing Combination Treatment]-1 and -2). Furthermore, in a recent randomised, placebo-controlled, Phase III trial (ISEL: IRESSA Survival Evaluation in Lung cancer), gefitinib failed to prolong survival compared with placebo in patients with advanced NSCLC who had failed one or more lines of chemotherapy. Subgroup analysis of ISEL suggested improved survival in patients of Asian origin and non-smokers. In addition, subset analyses of IDEAL and several retrospective studies have indicated that female gender, adenocarcinoma histology (especially bronchial alveolar carcinoma), non-smoker status and Asian ethnicity are factors which predict to response to gefitinib. Two types of somatic mutation clustered around the ATP binding pocket in the tyrosine kinase domain of the EGFR gene have been reported as possible surrogate biological markers for predicting response to gefitinib. Appropriate patient selection by clinical characteristics or genetical information is needed, both for future clinical trials of gefitinib and its routine use in the clinic among patients with advanced NSCLC. © 2005 Ashley Publications Ltd.","['Tamura, K.', 'Fukuoka, M.']",10.1517/14656566.6.6.985
The changing face of lung cancer,"The study by Toh et al has demonstrated no difference in both response to chemotherapy and overall survival between smokers and nonsmokers with non-small cell lung cancer. Of considerable concern is the fact that nonsmoking women in this Asian population are at considerably greater risk of developing lung cancer than their Western counterparts. There is clearly a complex interaction among gender, race, smoking status, and cell type in the subsequent development of lung cancer, and this interaction requires urgent attention from both researchers and public health authorities in order to slow the current epidemic of lung cancer in certain parts of the world. Perhaps more important than this research is the need to reverse the current push by tobacco companies into developing countries and Asia. It has been estimated that 20 million women have started smoking in China since 1990,23 and a doubling of smoking rates has been documented in Japanese women in recent years.24 If these trends continue, the prototype of the lung cancer patient (middle-aged to elderly Western man who smokes) may rapidly be replaced by the alternative (younger Asian women who both smoke and do not smoke).

Weighing social and economic determinants related to inequalities in mortality,"It is well known that there are social inequalities in health. Following the ecological approach, unemployment has been one of the most used indicators to study social inequalities. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationships between indicators of extreme poverty and social unrest, along with unemployment, and mortality in Barcelona, during the years 1989 to 1993. A cross-sectional ecological study was carried out using Primary Health Care Areas (PHCAs) as the unit of analysis. The study population consisted of residents in Barcelona City. The indicators studied as dependent variables were the age-standardized mortality rates of the following causes of death: total mortality; lung cancer; bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma; cirrhosis; cerebrovascular disease; ischemic heart disease; breast cancer; traffic accidents; acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); and drug overdose. Independent variables were male unemployment rate of the primary health care areas and indicators of extreme poverty and social conflict. A descriptive analysis, a bivariate analysis using Spearman correlation coefficients, and a multivariate analysis fitting Poisson regression models were carried out. For the main results, one group of causes of death was associated only with unemployment: bronchitis, emphysema and asthma, cerebrovascular disease, and ischemic heart disease (both men and women); lung cancer (only among men); total mortality and cirrhosis (only among women). Among men, another group of causes of death was associated with extreme poverty and/or social unrest, as well as unemployment: total mortality, cirrhosis, and drug overdose. AIDS in men was only associated with extreme poverty and social unrest. We concluded that we see different types of relationships between deprivation and mortality. Unemployment has been related to mortality because of pathologies with socially accepted risk factors (tobacco and alcohol). Causes of death with risk factors not socially accepted (illegal drug use) have been related to indicators of marginality as well as unemployment.","['Pasarín, M.I.', 'Borrell, C.', 'Brugal, M.T.', 'Díaz-Quijano, E.']",10.1093/jurban/jth123
An alternative approach to quantifying and addressing inequity in Healthcare provision: Access to surgery for lung cancer in the east of England,"Study objective: Equitable access to Healthcare services should be monitored routinely. This study compares provision of surgery for non-small cell lung cancer in the east of England with incidence of non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to conventional comparisons, process control charts are used to identify areas in which access seems to be significantly different from average. Design: Ecological comparison of surgery rates for non-small cell lung cancer between 1998 and 2000 and incidence of non-small cell lung cancer over the same time period. Setting: Population of Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire. Participants: The denominator was the resident population. Numerators were 4092 deaths from non-small cell lung cancer and 387 surgical procedures for lung cancer. Main results: Incidence of non-small cell lung cancer by primary care trust (PCT) does not correlate with surgical procedure rate, in men r=0.37 (95% confidence intervals -0.14 to 0.72), in women r=0.07 (95% confidence intervals -0.43 to 0.53). Control charts indicate that the surgery rate is significantly different from average in three PCTs, high in one and low in two others. The optimum surgery rate is unclear but raising it from 9% to a theoretical level of 15% would mean no PCTs have above average rates while six PCTs have rates that are significantly low. Conclusions: There does not seem to be equity of access to surgery for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in the east of England. Control charts can help both to identify areas where access is particularly high or low, and also to monitor performance against a theoretical optimum surgery rate.","['Battersby, J.', 'Flowers, J.', 'Harvey, I.']",10.1136/jech.2003.013391
Factors affecting the quality of life in lung cancer patients measured by EORTC QLQ questionnaire,"Objective: To evaluate the quality of life (QoL) of lung cancer patients and to investigate the differences in QoL with respect to social and medical characteristics. Methods: Structured questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13) were used in 106 consecutive lung cancer patients for data collection during January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002. The t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare the differences in QoL at a 5% level of significance. Results: The QoL of lung cancer patients were worse than reference value. The QoL of young, male and married patient groups was better than that in old, female and single groups. The QoL in patients with lower education or income was worse than that in patients with high education and income. Small cell lung cancer patients showed poorer QoL than non-small cell lung cancer patients did. The locally advanced or metastatic patients had worse QoL. All the kinds of treatments could worsen the QoL, however, the patients receiving surgical treatment had best QoL. Conclusion: The results suggest that the establishment of QoL judgment standard in Chinese lung cancer patients might be useful for clinicians, researchers and policy-makers.","['Cheng, X.', 'Zhou, D.', 'Lu, L.']",
Gender and lung cancer,"Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among men and women in the United States, female smokers appear to be at increased risk. After controlling for the number of cigarettes smoked, female sex imparts a significant, independent risk for most histologic types of lung cancer. Cigarette smoking, genetics, and endocrine factors may interact to contribute to the disparity in lung cancer risk between the sexes. Estrogens have direct and indirect actions in the lung, and estrogen has been implicated in lung carcinogenesis in female smokers. This review of the literature will focus on endocrine factors and tobacco carcinogens as risk factors for lung cancer in women.","['Gasperino, J.', 'Rom, W.N.']",10.3816/CLC.2004.n.013
Survey of quality of sleep in patients with primary lung cancer,"Aim: To survey the quality of sleep in patients with primary lung cancer, and to study its regularity so as to discuss the possible intervention. Methods: Eighty-four patients with primary lung cancer(lung cancer group) were matched with 84 normal subjects (control group) at the ratio of 1:1 in the same age, gender, profession, educational level and marital status. One week before treatment, the patients in the lung cancer group received the inventory of sleep quality, the evaluation of verbal rating scale (VRS) and symptom checklist-90 (SCL-90), but the subjects in the control group were only received the measurement of sleep quality survey during treatment. Results: In comparison of sleep quality survey between the two groups, the scores of factors of falling asleep (1.13 ± 0.43), maintaining sleep(0.39 ± 0.04), sleep self-assessment(0.80 ± 0.15) and total time of sleep (0.93 ± 0.20) as well as the total score of sleep quality (4.92 ± 0.87) in the lung cancer group were significantly higher than those in the control group(t = 2.095-2.941, P < 0.01-0.05). After the patients in the lung cancer group were divided into severe pain group(VRS 2-3 grade, 39 cases) and mild pain group(VRS 0-1 grade, 45 cases) in terms of different pain levels according to the VRS, the values of falling asleep, maintaining sleep, sleeping self-assessment, time of midday rest, general time of sleep and memory of dream as well as the total score of sleep quality in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the mild group(t = 2.178-2.674, P < 0.01-0.05). After the patients in the lung cancer group were divided into high SCL-90 group (≥ 140, 35 cases) and normal SCL-90 group(< 140, 49 cases) according to the SCL-90 scales, the values of falling asleep, maintaining sleep, sleeping self-assessment, general time of sleep and the total score of sleep quality in the high SCL-90 group were significantly higher than those in the normal SCL-90 group(t = 2.078-2.296, P < 0.05). Conclusion: The quality of sleep in patients with primary lung cancer decreases obviously, which is intimately related to the degrees of pain and mental state.","['Zhang, L.-H.', 'Gao, X.', 'Liu, X.-T.']",
The influence of socio-economic and locational disadvantage on patterns of surgical care for lung cancer in Western Australia 1982-2001,"OBJECTIVE: Patterns of in-hospital surgical care for lung cancer in Western Australia were examined, including the effects of demographic, locational and socio-economic disadvantage and the possession of private health insurance, on the likelihood of receiving surgery. RESULTS: Overall, 16% of patients received surgery for their lung cancer, although this varied according to histology. Patients who received surgery were typically younger, female, non-indigenous and had less comorbidity. Patients from socio-economically disadvantaged groups tended to be less likely to receive surgery (OR 0.79; 95% CI 0.61-1.04) although this was not significant for each category of disadvantage. Those who had their first hospital admission, with a mention of lung cancer, in a rural hospital were less likely to receive surgery (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.19-0.36) than those in metropolitan hospitals, although residential location generally had less effect (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14-0.92). Patients admitted as a private patient either to a private or public hospital for their first mention of lung cancer had increased likelihood of receiving surgery (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.02-1.30); however first admission to a private hospital had no effect (OR 0.99: 95% CI 0.85-1.16). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The WA Record Linkage Project was used to extract hospital morbidity, cancer and death records of all people with lung cancer in Western Australia from 1982 to 2001. The likelihood of receiving lung cancer surgery was estimated, after adjustment for co-variates, using logistic regression. CONCLUSION: The utilisation of lung cancer surgery was low with several factors found to affect the rate. Patients from socio-economically or locationally disadvantaged backgrounds, indigenous patients or patients without private health insurance were less likely to receive lung cancer surgery than those from more advantaged groups.","['Hall, S.E.', 'Holman, C.D.', 'Sheiner, H.']",10.1071/AH042720068
"Gender-specific aspects of epidemiology, molecular genetics and outcome: lung cancer.","Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide in women and men. In incidence, lung cancer ranks second, surpassed by breast cancer in  women and prostate cancer in men.

In the last decades, we have also witnessed an increased number of lung cancer in  female never-smokers. These disparities have grown our interest in studying the  impact of the gender and sex in the presentation of lung cancer. The aetiology is  yet to be fully elucidated, but the data are clear so far: there is a growing  divide between lung cancer presentation in women and men that will change our  management and study of lung cancer.

"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Cancer Survival: The Contribution of Tumor, Sociodemographic, Institutional, and Neighborhood Characteristics.","Purpose Racial/ethnic disparities in cancer survival in the United States are well documented, but the underlying causes are not well understood. We quantified  the contribution of tumor, treatment, hospital, sociodemographic, and  neighborhood factors to racial/ethnic survival disparities in California.  Materials and Methods California Cancer Registry data were used to estimate  population-based cancer-specific survival for patients diagnosed with breast,  prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer between 2000 and 2013 for each racial/ethnic  group (non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and  separately each for Chinese, Japanese, and Filipino) compared with non-Hispanic  whites. The percentage contribution of factors to overall racial/ethnic survival  disparities was estimated from a sequence of multivariable Cox proportional  hazards models. Results In baseline models, black patients had the lowest  survival for all cancer sites, and Asian American and Pacific Islander patients  had the highest, compared with whites. Mediation analyses suggested that stage at  diagnosis had the greatest influence on overall racial/ethnic survival  disparities accounting for 24% of disparities in breast cancer, 24% in prostate  cancer, and 16% to 30% in colorectal cancer. Neighborhood socioeconomic status  was an important factor in all cancers, but only for black and Hispanic patients.  The influence of marital status on racial/ethnic disparities was stronger in men  than in women. Adjustment for all covariables explained approximately half of the  overall survival disparities in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but it  explained only 15% to 40% of disparities in lung cancer. Conclusion Overall  reductions in racial/ethnic survival disparities were driven largely by  reductions for black compared with white patients. Stage at diagnosis had the  largest effect on racial/ethnic survival disparities, but earlier detection would  not entirely eliminate them. The influences of neighborhood socioeconomic status  and marital status suggest that social determinants, support mechanisms, and  access to health care are important contributing factors.","['Ellis, Libby', 'Canchola, Alison J.', 'Spiegel, David', 'Ladabaum, Uri', 'Haile, Robert', 'Gomez, Scarlett Lin']",10.1200/JCO.2017.74.2049
Gender and lung cancer-SEER-based analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer remains a major cause of death worldwide. While in the past it was considered to primarily afflict males, in recent decades the number  of female patients has risen, such that rates among females are similar to those  among males. Nevertheless, it has been found previously (e.g., in cardiovascular  disease) that when there is a sex-specific stereotype to a disease, it may remain  entrenched in medical diagnostic processes, so as to cause belated diagnosis  among the other sex. Gender-based differences in incidence and diagnosis are  likely to exist with respect to lung cancer because of smoking habits and  stereotypes, geographic and socioeconomic differences, and past epidemiologic  differences between the sexes. Here we aim to characterize the effects of gender  on lung cancer diagnosis and whether such effects have changed over time.  METHODS: The SEER (Statistics, Epidemiology, and End Results) database was used  to check for sex-based differences by tumor type and stage at diagnosis and to  investigate whether these patterns have changed with time by comparing staging  data in different age cohorts over time. Results were stratified by location and  analyzed with data regarding possible confounders such as smoking and  socioeconomic factors. RESULTS: We examined 458,132 cases of lung cancer from the  years 2004-2012; 243,021 (53%) in males and 215,111 (47%) in females. Lung cancer  rates were 73.8 (73.5-74.1) per 100k in males and 51.6 (51.4-51.8) per 100k in  females. Of these, 400,800 had the stage listed, 214,479 (54%) in males, and  186,321 (46%) in females. Total lung cancer rates were higher in males than  females at all disease stages. Male patients were more likely than female  patients to be diagnosed at stage 3-4, consistent across lung cancer types,  cancer registries, smoking, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The difference between  the percentage of males versus females diagnosed in stages 3-4 correlated  negatively with increased female ever-smokers and with squamous and small cell  carcinoma and were not correlated with the rate of cancer in females, or the  difference between male and female cancer rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed  that there is no belated diagnosis of lung cancer in females. Results appear to  point to the fact that smoking females are more likely to be diagnosed at later  stages, which is consistent with the current literature.","['Tolwin, Yaakov', 'Gillis, Roni', 'Peled, Nir']",10.1016/j.annepidem.2020.04.003
Social vulnerability and lung malignancy mortality.,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is a major cause of death in the United States. Social determinants of health (SDOH) are important factors that impact the treatment and  prognosis of lung cancer. The social vulnerability index (SVI) is a validated  measure of SDOH. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the impact of  the SVI on lung cancer mortality using descriptive epidemiology. METHODS:  Mortality data for lung malignancies from 2014 to 2018 was obtained from the CDC  database and was age-adjusted and standardized to the population in the year  2000. The SVI for the same years was obtained from the CDC Agency for Toxic  Substances and Disease Registry database. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR)  were estimated for each SVI quartile (SVI-Q) and demographic subgroup. RESULTS:  We found that counties in SVI-Q4 (most vulnerable) had a higher cumulative AAMR  compared to counties in SVI-Q1 (least vulnerable), accounting for a 4.48 excess  death rate per 100,000 person-years. AAMR among males in SVI-Q4 was higher  compared to SVI-Q1, accounting for a 9.96 excess death rate per 100,000  person-years, whereas no mortality differences were observed for female  populations between SVI-Q4 and SVI-Q1. AAMR in SVI-Q4 was higher for both  Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations, except for American Indian/Alaska Native  populations. Similar trends were observed in both metropolitan and  non-metropolitan counties. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that the SVI may play a  significant role in lung cancer mortality and highlights the need for  interventions targeting vulnerable populations to improve outcomes.","['Ibrahim, Ramzi', 'Sakr, Lewjain', 'Lewis, Jennifer A.', 'Kim, Roger Y.', 'Benn, Bryan S.', 'Low, See-Wei']",10.1016/j.jcpo.2023.100453
Gender Differences and Immunotherapy Outcome in Advanced Lung Cancer.,"In developed countries, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in both sexes. Although cigarette smoking represents the principal risk factor  for lung cancer in females, the higher proportion of this neoplasm among  non-smoking women as compared with non-smoking men implies distinctive biological  aspects between the two sexes. Gender differences depend not only on genetic,  environmental, and hormonal factors but also on the immune system, and all these  aspects are closely interconnected. In the last few years, it has been confirmed  that the immune system plays a fundamental role in cancer evolution and response  to oncological treatments, specifically immunotherapy, with documented  distinctions between men and women. Consequently, in order to correctly assess  cancer responses and disease control, considering only age and reproductive  status, the results of studies conducted in female patients would probably not  categorically apply to male patients and vice versa. The aim of this article is  to review recent data about gender disparities in both healthy subjects' immune  system and lung cancer patients; furthermore, studies concerning gender  differences in response to lung cancer immunotherapy are examined.","['Vavalà, Tiziana', 'Catino, Annamaria', 'Pizzutilo, Pamela', 'Longo, Vito', 'Galetta, Domenico']",10.3390/ijms222111942
A consensus statement on the gender perspective in lung cancer.,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer globally and has the highest mortality. Although this disease is not associated with a particular gender, its incidence  is rising among women, who are diagnosed at an increasingly younger age compared  with men. One of the main reasons for this rise is women taking up smoking.  However, many non-smoking women also develop this disease. Other risk factors  implicated in the differential development of lung cancer in women are genetic  predisposition, tumour histology and molecular profile. Proportionally more women  than men with lung cancer have a mutation in the EGFR gene. This consensus  statement reviews the available evidence about the epidemiological, biological,  diagnostic, therapeutic, social and psychological aspects of lung cancer in  women.","['Isla, D.', 'Majem, M.', 'Viñolas, N.', 'Artal, A.', 'Blasco, A.', 'Felip, E.', 'Garrido, P.', 'Remón, J.', 'Baquedano, M.', 'Borrás, J.

Sex and gender differences in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Historically, lung cancer has been viewed as a male disease, but during the past 50 years there has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of lung cancer in  women. Lung cancer is currently the most common cause of cancer death in American  women, accounting for more than one quarter of all cancer deaths. This has been  attributed to a significant increase in tobacco consumption by women; however,  approximately 1 in 5 women with lung cancer never smoked. As the incidence of  lung cancer in women has increased, significant gender-based differences in  epidemiology, biology, and treatment responses have become evident and warrant  further investigation to advance the treatment of lung cancer in all patients.","['Donington, Jessica S.', 'Colson, Yolonda L.']",10.1053/j.semtcvs.2011.07.001
Lung cancer survival and sex-specific patterns in Portugal: A population-based analysis.,"INTRODUCTION: In Portugal, lung cancer (LC) is the first cause of cancer-related death and of death and disability combined. This study aims to analyze the  overall survival (OS) and relative survival (RS) of patients diagnosed with LC in  2009-2011 by socio-demographic and tumor characteristics, and analyze  sex-specific patterns. METHODS: We estimated 5-year OS using the Kaplan-Meier  method and 5-year net survival through the RS framework. Cox regression modeling  was used to determine the hazard ratio (HR) of death associated with each  independent variable. FINDINGS: For the 11,523 cases analyzed, median 5-year OS  was 264 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 254.8-273.2), the cumulative OS was  13.6% and RS was 15.1%. Males had a lower median survival (237 days; 95% CI:  228.2-245.7) compared to females (416 days; 95% CI: 384.4-447.6) (p < 0.0001) and  lower 5-year RS proportions (12.1% vs. 24.9%). RS progressively decreased with  age (41.7% for age-group <40 to 7.2% for ≥80) and stage (66.6% for stage I to  2.4% for stage IV). As predictors of decreased survival, we identified male  gender, increasing age >50, histologic types (squamous cell carcinoma, non-small  cell lung cancer not otherwise specified, other unspecified and small cell lung  cancer), and increasing stage. Compared to women, the risk of death in men was  37.7% higher (HR = 1.386; 95% CI: 1.295-1.484). CONCLUSIONS: The differences  between OS and RS were small, reflecting the high lethality of LC. Male gender  and older age are factors related to poor prognosis. Histology also plays a role  in survival prognosis and varies with gender, but the factor related to the worst  survival is stage. Although the study reflects data from a decade ago, and major  changes occurred in diagnosis, staging and treatment, particularly for advanced  disease, as LC mortality is strongly correlated with late stage diagnosis, all  efforts should be made to secure early diagnosis and improve survival prospects.","['Guerreiro, T.', 'Forjaz, G.', 'Antunes, L.', 'Bastos, J.', 'Mayer, A.', 'Aguiar, P.', 'Araújo, A.', 'Nunes, C.']",10.1016/j.pulmoe.2021.09.001
"Spatial Analysis of Regional Factors and Lung Cancer Mortality in China, 1973-2013.","Background: China's lung cancer crude death rate has increased 6.9-fold from 1973 to 2014. During this time, the country experienced extremely rapid economic  growth and social change. It is important to understand the effects of risk  factors on lung cancer mortality (LCM) for better allocation of limited resources  of cancer prevention and control in China.Methods: Using three nationwide  mortality surveys from 1973 to 2005, Global Health Data Exchange data in 2013,  three nationwide smoking surveys from 1984 to 2013, four population censuses from  1964 to 2000, and other datasets, we have compiled datasets and developed spatial  random effect models to assess the association of various area-level-contributing  factors on LCM. Spatial scan statistics are used to detect high-risk clusters of  LCM.Results: LCM is higher in urban and more industrialized areas (RR = 1.17)  compared with those in rural areas. The level of industrial development's effect  is higher for men, which accounts for about 70% of all LCM. Smoking is positively  associated with regional variation of LCM rates, and the effect is higher for  women than for men.Conclusions: The geographic pattern of high LCM in China is  different from that of Western countries. LCM is positively associated with  higher socioeconomic status, with more urbanized areas at a higher level of  industrial development.Impact: There is a need to further explore additional risk  in the high-risk clusters. The study is about China, but this situation may  happen in other countries experiencing rapid industrialization and other  developing countries.

Gender and Regional Differences in Lung Cancer Mortality in Brazil.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This was a population-based ecological with data of deaths from the Mortality Information System. The objective of this study was to  analyze the temporal trends of mortality induced by bronchi and lung cancer in  Brazil and its geographical regions between 2001 and 2015 and secondly to  calculate predictions for 2016-2030. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The mortality trends  were analyzed by the Joinpoint regression and calculation of predictions was used  the Nordpred software. RESULTS: There was a reduction trend in lung cancer  mortality among Brazilian men living in South and Southeast regions of Brazil.  However, there was an increasing trend in lung cancer mortality among Brazilian  women living in Northeast, Southeast, and South regions of Brazil. When comparing  the last observed period and the last foreseen period for males, it is expected  an increase of 12.86% in the number of deaths, justified mainly by the change in  population structure, with a reduction in the risk of death by the disease. For  women, the expected increase is 26.22%, justified both by population structure,  and the increased risk of deaths from the disease. The higher rates will be  observed in the southern region of the country, for both sexes. CONCLUSION: The  mortality induced by lung and bronchial cancer in Brazil was unevenly  distributed. However lung cancer incidence had a reducing trend, the mortality  caused following it was increased among men. For women, the rates are rising, and  until 2030, the mortality load will continue to rise for both.<br />.","['Costa, Suellen Nadine De Lima', 'Fernandes, Fabia Cheyenne Gomes De Morais', 'Santos, Camila Alves Dos', 'Souza, Dyego Leandro Bezerra De', 'Barbosa, Isabelle Ribeiro']",10.31557/APJCP.2020.21.4.919
"Sociodemographic Survival Disparities for Lung Cancer in the United States, 2000-2016.","BACKGROUND: Understanding the impact of patient and tumor characteristics on lung cancer survival can help build personalized prognostic models and identify health  disparities. METHODS: We identified 557 555 patients aged 25 years and older  diagnosed with lung or bronchus carcinoma from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,  and End Results database, 2000-2016. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) for  demographic (sex, age, race and ethnicity), tumor (stage, histology, year of  diagnosis), and geographic characteristics (census tract-level urbanicity,  socioeconomic status [SES]), as well as selected interactions, on the rate of  lung cancer-specific death using multivariable proportional hazards models.  RESULTS: Women had a higher survival (lower hazard) of lung cancer-specific death  than men (HR = 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82 to 0.83). Hazards  differed by race and ethnicity. Regional (HR = 2.41, 95% CI = 2.37 to 2.44) and  distant (HR = 6.61, 95% CI = 6.53 to 6.69) tumors were associated with a lower  survival (higher hazard) than localized tumors. Small cell tumors were associated  with a lower survival (HR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.20) than non-small cell  tumors. Patients diagnosed after 2009 had lower hazards (HR = 0.86, 95% CI = 085  to 0.86) than those diagnosed 2000-2009. Lung cancer-specific survival did not  depend on urbanicity after adjusting for census tract-level SES, but survival  decreased with decreasing census tract-level SES. Differences in survival between  non-Hispanic Black and White patients were greater for younger patients and  localized tumors and increased with census tract-level SES. Differences by sex  were greatest for young patients and localized tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities  in survival after lung cancer diagnosis remain, with intersectional patterns  suggesting differential access to and quality of care. Efforts are needed to  ensure that high-risk groups receive guideline-concordant treatment.","['Brouwer, Andrew F.', 'Engle, Jason M.', 'Jeon, Jihyoun', 'Meza, Rafael']",10.1093/jnci/djac144
"Incidence and mortality rates of lung cancer in Qingdao, China (2013-2017).","AIMS: To analyze lung cancer incidence and mortality rates from 2013 to 2017 in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China. METHODS: The lung cancer new cases and death  data during 2013-2017 were collected from the Qingdao Cancer Surveillance System.  The crude incidence and mortality rates were calculated by residential area and  gender. The annual percentage change (APC) was determined to evaluate the  incidence and mortality rate trends. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2017, 31 653 new  lung cancer cases and 24 965 deaths from lung cancer were retrieved. The  age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) were 42.1  per 100 000. The crude incidence rates for men and women increased from 85.2 and  46.3 per 100 000 in 2013 to 124.0 and 67.4 per 100 000 in 2017, respectively. The  APCs were 7.8% for men (P < .001) and 7.5% (P = .027) for women. The crude  mortality rates increased from 56.3 per 100 000 in 2013 to 68.0 per 100 000 in  2017. The age-standardized mortality rates by ASIRC were 32.3 per 100 000. The  APCs of mortality rates were higher in men than in women and were higher in rural  than in urban areas. Age-specific incidence and mortality rates were lower in  individuals aged <40 years, increased sharply in those aged >40 years, and were  the highest in 80-year-old individuals. CONCLUSION: These data show different  patterns of incidence and mortality rate according to gender and resident area  during 2013-2017. Early screening and targeted prevention should be implemented  to control the increased trend of lung cancer.","['Sun, Xiaohui', 'Xu, Xiang', 'Wang, Yumei', 'Hou, Binghui', 'Luo, Tingting', 'Meng, Di', 'Wang, Shaojie', 'Ning, Feng']",10.1111/ajco.13559
Work-Related Factors and Lung Cancer Survival: A Population-Based Study in Switzerland (1990-2014).,"While previous Swiss studies have demonstrated differences in lung cancer mortality between occupational groups, no estimates are available on the  association of occupation-related factors with lung cancer survival. This study  aimed at determining whether occupation or work-related factors after diagnosis  affect lung cancer survival. We used cancer registry records to identify lung  cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 2014 in western Switzerland (n = 5773)  matched with the Swiss National Cohort. The effect of occupation, the skill level  required for the occupation, and the socio-professional category on 5-year lung  cancer survival was assessed using non-parametric and parametric methods,  controlling for histological type and tumour stage. We found that the net  survival varied across skill levels and that the lowest skill level was  associated with worse survival in both men and women. In the parametric models  with minimal adjustment, we identified several occupational groups at higher risk  of mortality compared to the reference category, particularly among men. After  adjustment for histological type of lung cancer and tumour stage at diagnosis,  most hazard ratios remained higher than 1, though non-statistically significant.  Compared to top managers and self-employed workers, workers in paid employment  without specific information on occupation were identified as the most at-risk  socio-professional category in nearly all models. As this study was conducted  using a relatively small sample and limited set of covariates, further studies  are required, taking into account smoking habits and administrated cancer  treatments. Information on return to work and working conditions before and after  lung cancer diagnosis will also be highly valuable for analysing their effect on  net lung cancer survival in large nationwide or international studies. Such  studies are essential for informing health and social protection systems, which  should guarantee appropriate work conditions for cancer survivors, beneficial for  their quality of life and survival.","['Bovio, Nicolas', 'Grzebyk, Michel', 'Arveux, Patrick', 'Bulliard, Jean-Luc', 'Chiolero, Arnaud', 'Fournier, Evelyne', 'Germann, Simon', 'Konzelmann, Isabelle', 'Maspoli, Manuela', 'Rapiti, Elisabetta', 'Guseva Canu, Irina']",10.3390/ijerph192113856
Epidemiology of lung cancer: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (2nd edition).,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to summarize the published literature concerning the epidemiology of lung cancer. METHODS: A narrative review of  published evidence was conducted, identifying and summarizing key reports that  describe the occurrence of lung cancer in populations and factors that affect  lung cancer risk. RESULTS: In the United States, lung cancer remains the leading  cause of cancer death in both men and women, even though an extensive list of  modifiable risk factors has long been identified. The predominant cause of lung  cancer is exposure to tobacco smoke, with active smoking causing most cases but  passive smoking also contributing to the lung cancer burden. CONCLUSIONS: The  reductions in smoking prevalence in men that occurred in the late 1960s through  the 1980s will continue to drive lung cancer mortality rates downward in men  during the first portion of this century, but rates in women have not yet begun  to decrease. Fortunately, exposures to major occupational respiratory carcinogens  have largely been controlled, but the population is still exposed to  environmental causes of lung cancer, including radon, the second leading cause of  lung cancer death.","['Alberg, Anthony J.', 'Ford, Jean G.', 'Samet, Jonathan M.']",10.1378/chest.07-1347
Social impacts of the work loss in cancer survivors.,"BACKGROUND: As cancer frequently occurs during the most productive years of life, our purpose was to estimate the cost of work loss of cancer survivors and develop  interventions to minimize the loss. METHODS: We estimated the cost of the work  loss from all cancers resulting from patients' inpatient, outpatient, and  non-treatment days. This was calculated with a new method, the product of the  ""employment rate coefficient × productivity coefficient,"" making use of data  published by the Japanese Ministries. RESULTS: The estimate of work loss on  treatment days for all cancers was $1820.21 million in men and $939.38 million in  women. In terms of disease classification, lung cancer was the largest cause in  men, whereas breast cancer was the largest in women. On non-treatment days, the  work losses because of gastric, colon, and lung cancers were large in men, while  breast cancer was the largest in women and in total. The estimated loss for all  cancers was $3685.506 million in men and $2502.565 million in women, when the  product was assumed 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, breast cancer was considered the  leading cause for cost of work loss, and the most influential cause when the  product of the ""employment rate coefficient × productivity coefficient"" for  breast cancer was assumed the same as the product for all other types of cancers.  It is necessary to establish support systems for working cancer survivors.","['Yamauchi, Hideko', 'Nakagawa, Chizuko', 'Fukuda, Takashi']",10.1007/s12282-017-0759-y
Lung cancer and occupation in a population-based case-control study.,"The authors examined the relation between occupation and lung cancer in the large, population-based Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE)  case-control study. In 2002-2005 in the Lombardy region of northern Italy, 2,100  incident lung cancer cases and 2,120 randomly selected population controls were  enrolled. Lifetime occupational histories (industry and job title) were coded by  using standard international classifications and were translated into occupations  known (list A) or suspected (list B) to be associated with lung cancer.  Smoking-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with  logistic regression. For men, an increased risk was found for list A (177 exposed  cases and 100 controls; odds ratio = 1.74, 95% confidence interval: 1.27, 2.38)  and most occupations therein. No overall excess was found for list B with the  exception of filling station attendants and bus and truck drivers (men) and  launderers and dry cleaners (women). The authors estimated that 4.9% (95%  confidence interval: 2.0, 7.8) of lung cancers in men were attributable to  occupation. Among those in other occupations, risk excesses were found for metal  workers, barbers and hairdressers, and other motor vehicle drivers. These results  indicate that past exposure to occupational carcinogens remains an important  determinant of lung cancer occurrence.","['Consonni, Dario', 'De Matteis, Sara', 'Lubin, Jay H.', 'Wacholder, Sholom', 'Tucker, Margaret', 'Pesatori, Angela Cecilia', 'Caporaso, Neil E.', 'Bertazzi, Pier Alberto', 'Landi, Maria Teresa']",10.1093/aje/kwp391
Impact of occupational carcinogens on lung cancer risk in a general population.,"BACKGROUND: Exposure to occupational carcinogens is an important preventable cause of lung cancer. Most of the previous studies were in highly exposed  industrial cohorts. Our aim was to quantify lung cancer burden attributable to  occupational carcinogens in a general population. METHODS: We applied a new  job-exposure matrix (JEM) to translate lifetime work histories, collected by  personal interview and coded into standard job titles, into never, low and high  exposure levels for six known/suspected occupational lung carcinogens in the  Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) population-based  case-control study, conducted in Lombardy region, Italy, in 2002-05. Odds ratios  (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in men (1537 cases and  1617 controls), by logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders,  including smoking and co-exposure to JEM carcinogens. The population attributable  fraction (PAF) was estimated as impact measure. RESULTS: Men showed an increased  lung cancer risk even at low exposure to asbestos (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.42-2.18),  crystalline silica (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.00-1.71) and nickel-chromium (OR: 1.18;  95% CI: 0.90-1.53); risk increased with exposure level. For polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons, an increased risk (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.99-2.70) was found only for  high exposures. The PAFs for any exposure to asbestos, silica and nickel-chromium  were 18.1, 5.7 and 7.0%, respectively, equivalent to an overall PAF of 22.5% (95%  CI: 14.1-30.0). This corresponds to about 1016 (95% CI: 637-1355) male lung  cancer cases/year in Lombardy. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the  substantial role of selected occupational carcinogens on lung cancer burden, even  at low exposures, in a general population.","['De Matteis, Sara', 'Consonni, Dario', 'Lubin, Jay H.', 'Tucker, Margaret', 'Peters, Susan', 'Vermeulen, Roel Ch', 'Kromhout, Hans', 'Bertazzi, Pier Alberto', 'Caporaso, Neil E.', 'Pesatori, Angela C.', 'Wacholder, Sholom', 'Landi, Maria Teresa']",10.1093/ije/dys042
Socioeconomic Factors Are Associated With Readmission After Lobectomy for Early Stage Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Data regarding risk factors for readmissions after surgical resection for lung cancer are limited and largely focus on postoperative outcomes,  including complications and hospital length of stay. The current study aims to  identify preoperative risk factors for postoperative readmission in early stage  lung cancer patients. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for all  early stage lung cancer patients with clinical stage T2N0M0 or less who underwent  lobectomy in 2010 and 2011. Patients with unplanned readmission within 30 days of  hospital discharge were identified. Univariate analysis was utilized to identify  preoperative differences between readmitted and not readmitted cohorts;  multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors resulting in  readmission. RESULTS: In all, 840 of 19,711 patients (4.3%) were readmitted  postoperatively. Male patients were more likely to be readmitted than female  patients (4.9% versus 3.8%, p < 0.001), as were patients who received surgery at  a nonacademic rather than an academic facility (4.6% versus 3.6%; p = 0.001) and  had underlying medical comorbidities (Charlson/Deyo score 1+ versus 0; 4.8%  versus 3.7%; p < 0.001). Readmitted patients had a longer median hospital length  of stay (6 days versus 5; p < 0.001) and were more likely to have undergone a  minimally invasive approach (5.1% video-assisted thoracic surgery versus 3.9%  open; p < 0.001). In addition to those variables, multivariable logistic  regression analysis identified that median household income level, insurance  status (government versus private), and geographic residence (metropolitan versus  urban versus rural) had significant influence on readmission. CONCLUSIONS: The  socioeconomic factors identified significantly influence hospital readmission and  should be considered during preoperative and postoperative discharge planning for  patients with early stage lung cancer.","['Medbery, Rachel L.', 'Gillespie, Theresa W.', 'Liu, Yuan', 'Nickleach, Dana C.', 'Lipscomb, Joseph', 'Sancheti, Manu S.', 'Pickens, Allan', 'Force, Seth D.', 'Fernandez, Felix G.']",10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.05.060
Lung cancer in Malabar Cancer Center in Kerala--a descriptive analysis.,"The burden of lung cancer in terms of mortality is the highest among all types of cancers globally. The present study aimed to evaluate lifestyle related habits,  clinico-pathological profile and treatment details of lung cancer patients who  were registered at Malabar Cancer Centre (MCC), Kerala, during the calendar year  2010. A retrospective evaluation was made from medical records to gather data  from 281 registered lung cancer cases in 241 males and 40 females, with a male to  female ratio of 6.03: 1. Approximately 89% of the cases were above 50 years of  age. Among males about 91% of the cases were smokers and 62% of them had a  chronic smoking habit. Adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, non-small cell  carcinomas and small cell cancers accounted for 10.7, 13.9, 17.0 and 5.7%  respectively. Out of 281 cases around 67% were diagnosed with distant metastasis  and the remainder had regional lymph node involvement. However, no statistically  significant difference was observed for secondary site of tumor according to  gender. As majority of the cases reported at MCC were in an advanced stage of the  disease, histology of the secondary site from supraclavicular lymph nodes or  liver was taken for diagnosis. Initiation of population based screening for early  detection of cancer, and primary and secondary prevention strategies for reducing  the prevalence of tobacco consumption are high priorities to reduce the lung  cancer burden in Kerala.","['Bhaskarapillai, Binukumar', 'Kumar, Saina Sunil', 'Balasubramanian, Satheesan']",10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.9.4639
Population-based Treatment Patterns and Outcomes for Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A Real-world Evidence Study.,"BACKGROUND: Most patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop metastases and succumb to their cancer. Approaches to the treatment of  stage III disease can be highly variable. Understanding current treatment  patterns can inform the optimal integration of emerging therapies. In this study,  we describe contemporary treatment patterns and outcomes for a population-based  cohort of stage III NSCLC patients from a large Canadian province. METHODS: On  the basis of the provincial cancer registry, all adult patients diagnosed with  stage III NSCLC from April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2015 were identified. Analyses of  these patients' existing electronic medical records and administrative claims  data were conducted to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and  survival outcomes. RESULTS: In total, we screened 6438 patients diagnosed with  NSCLC, of whom 1151 (17.9%) had stage III disease. Among them, 61.2% were stage  IIIA, 36.4% were stage IIIB, and 2.4% were unspecified. Median age at diagnosis  was 70 (22 to 94) years and 50.2% were men. In this cohort, a significant  proportion of patients received only palliative radiotherapy (35.6%), palliative  chemotherapy (8.8%), or best supportive care (24.8%) as initial treatment.  Conversely, relatively few underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy (11.7%) or  trimodality therapy (1.7%). Surgery±adjuvant treatments were performed in 14.8%  of stage III patients. Median overall survival was 13.2 months (95% confidence  interval [CI], 12.2-14.0) among stage III patients. Patients who received initial  curative treatment had statistically significant better survival compared with  those who received noncurative treatment (P<0.001); median overall survival 29.8  months (95% CI, 22.3-34.6) and 8.9 months (95% CI, 7.6-11.6), respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based setting that includes community, regional, and  tertiary cancer centers, use of concurrent chemoradiotherapy and trimodality  therapy in stage III NSCLC was low despite evidence supporting the potential  benefits of these strategies.","['Yusuf, Dimas', 'Walton, Ryan N.', 'Hurry, Manjusha', 'Farrer, Christie', 'Bebb, D.

Symptom clusters and quality of life in China patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy.,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the symptom clusters and quality of life in patients with lung cancer undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was  completed with 183 patients from three public hospitals in Xi'an, China. Patients  completed a demographic questionnaire, the Functional Assessment of Cancer  Therapy-Lung Cancer (FACT-L) and the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI-C).  Factor analysis was used to identify symptom clusters based on the severity of  patients' symptom experiences. The resulting clusters were correlated with  quality-of-life measures. RESULTS: The QOL scores of lung cancer patients on the  functioning subscale were the lowest (9.70±5.30), while those of the family  subscale were the highest (19.28±3.24). Three symptom clusters were identified:  gastrointestinal, emotional and fatigue-related symptoms. There was a negative  relationship between the symptom clusters and multiple dimensions of quality of  life (r -0.178 ∼-0.805, p< 0. 05). Females, especially those women with low  education level /chronic diseases, were experienced greater symptom distress than  others. CONCLUSIONS: The clusters had a negative relationship with QOL.  Identifying symptom clusters helped clarify possible inter-relationships which  may lead to the establishment of more effective symptom management interventions  for patients with lung cancer in order to improve the quality of life.","['Wang, Dandan', 'Fu, Jufang']",10.4314/ahs.v14i1.8
Characteristics of Lung Cancer in Patients Younger than 40 Years: A Prospective Multicenter Analysis in France.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the demographic and clinico-pathological characteristics of lung cancer in patients younger than 40  years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study performed within the  Groupe Français de Pneumo-Cancérologie. Consecutive patients diagnosed with lung  cancer before the age of 40 years were eligible. Data on demographics, medical  history, clinico-pathological characteristics, treatment and overall survival  were analysed. RESULTS: In total, 146 patients were included from January 2011 to  December 2013. Median age was 38 years (IQR: 34-40). Women accounted for 41%.  Main histological type was adenocarcinoma (77%). Only 3% had a prior history of  cancer, but a family history (first- or second-degree relatives) of cancer was  reported in 80 (55%) patients; 85 and 50% were current or past smokers of tobacco  and cannabis, respectively; 82% had stage IIIB/IV at diagnosis. Median overall  survival was 15.3 (95% CI: 8.1-24.0) months in the whole population, 10.3 (95%  CI: 12.5-14.2) months in stage IV and 15 (95% CI: 8.7-35.2) months in stage III.  One- and two-year overall survival rates were 57% (95 CI: 49-65) and 31.5% (95  CI: 27-43), respectively. Compared to smokers, non-smokers were significantly  younger and more often females. Median overall survival was not statistically  different between smokers and non-smokers.","['Bigay-Gamé, Laurence', 'Bota, Suzanna', 'Greillier, Laurent', 'Monnet, Isabelle', 'Madroszyk, Anne', 'Corre, Romain', 'Mastroianni, Bénédicte', 'Falchero, Lionel', 'Mazières, Julien', 'Colineaux, Hélène', 'Lepage, Benoit', 'Chouaid, Christos']",10.1159/000489784
"Effectiveness of Lung-RADS in Reducing False-Positive Results in a Diverse, Underserved, Urban Lung Cancer Screening Cohort.","PURPOSE: The Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System(TM) (Lung-RADS(TM)) was created to standardize lung cancer screening CT reporting and recommendations but  has not been well validated prospectively in clinical practice. The aim of this  study was to determine the effectiveness of lung cancer screening using Lung-RADS  in a diverse, underserved, academic clinical screening program, focusing on  whether Lung-RADS would successfully reduce the 23.3% false-positive rate found  in the National Lung Screening Trial. METHODS: Institutional review board  approval was obtained to study the clinical lung cancer screening cohort.  Low-dose CT results were prospectively assigned a Lung-RADS or equivalent score.  The proportion of examinations in each Lung-RADS category and the corresponding  lung cancer rate, subsequent imaging, interventions, mortality, and compliance  were tracked. The National Death Index was queried for follow-up losses. RESULTS:  The cohort comprised 1,181 patients with 2,270 person-years of follow-up from  December 2012 to December 2016. The mean age was 64 ± 16.2 years, with 51% women,  63% nonwhite, 71% current smokers, 69% overweight and obese, and multiple  comorbidities. The Lung-RADS false-positive rate was 10.4% (95% confidence  interval, 8.8%-12.3%). Baseline CT results were negative in 87% (n = 1,031): for  Lung-RADS 1, the lung cancer rate was 0.2%, and for Lung-RADS 2, the cancer rate  was 0.5%. Positive baseline examinations were Lung-RADS 3 in 10% (n = 119), 4a in  1.2% (n = 14), and 4b in 1.5% (n = 18). Corresponding cancer rates were 3.4%,  43%, and 83%, respectively. Lung cancer prevalence was 2.1%. Mortality was 40% in  patients with lung cancer versus 2.5% in the remaining cohort (P < .001).  Fifty-four percent of patients were overdue for first annual examinations.  Eighty-four percent of patients (n = 989) had follow-up verified via electronic  records or personal contact, and the remainder had vital status ascertained via  the National Death Index. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer screening using Lung-RADS was  effective in reducing the false-positive rate compared with the National Lung  Screening Trial in a diverse and underserved urban population.","['Kaminetzky, Mark', 'Milch, Hannah S.', 'Shmukler, Anna', 'Kessler, Abraham', 'Peng, Robert', 'Mardakhaev, Edward', 'Bellin, Eran Y.', 'Levsky, Jeffrey M.', 'Haramati, Linda B.']",10.1016/j.jacr.2018.07.011
Gender Differences in Long-Term Survival after Surgery for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Background This retrospective study examined gender differences in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by analyzing surgical cases at a single institution. Patients  and Methods In this study, 735 NSCLC patients who underwent surgery from 1995 to  2010 were included. Clinical and pathological characteristics were retrieved by  reviewing charts retrospectively, and variables between genders were compared.  Results There were 489 males and 246 females in the study. The percentage of  screening-detected lung cancers (83.7%), never smokers (82.9%), adenocarcinoma  histology (90.7%), and pathological stage IA (42.7%) was higher in females than  that in males (71.2, 8.2, 51.3, and 23.1%, respectively). Female patients had  fewer cases of coronary artery disease (2.8%) and fewer pneumonectomy cases  (2.0%) than the male patients (7.4 and 5.3%, respectively). The median follow-up  period after surgery was 5.9 years. The overall survival rates at 5 years were  57.3% for males and 76.2% for females (p < 0.001, log-rank test). Based on  univariate analysis, we report that histology, smoking history, and pathological  stage were significant prognostic factors in addition to gender. Based on  multivariate analysis, pathological stage III/IV (hazard ratio, 3.60; 95%  confidence interval [CI], 2.84-4.54) and female gender (hazard ratio, 0.55; 95%  CI, 0.37-0.82) were significant prognostic factors. Subgroup analysis  demonstrated that female gender and adenocarcinoma histology were significant  positive prognostic factors only in pathological stages I and II (n = 557).  Conclusion Female gender as well as pathological stage was favorable prognostic  factors. The survival advantage observed in female NSCLC patients was limited to  those with cancer at stages I and II.","['Yoshida, Yukihiro', 'Murayama, Tomonori', 'Sato, Yasunori', 'Suzuki, Yoshio', 'Saito, Haruhisa', 'Nomura, Yukihiro']",10.1055/s-0035-1558995
Spatiotemporal Variations in Lung Cancer Mortality in China between 2006 and 2012: A Multilevel Analysis.,"We investigated temporal trends and geographical variations in lung cancer mortality in China from 2006 to 2012. Lung cancer mortality counts for people  aged over 40 years were extracted from the China Mortality Surveillance System  for 161 disease surveillance points. Negative binomial regression was used to  investigate potential spatiotemporal variation and correlations with age, gender,  urbanization, and region. Lung cancer mortality increased in China over the study  period from 78.77 to 85.63 (1/100,000), with higher mortality rates evident in  men compared to women. Median rate ratios (MRRs) indicated important geographical  variation in lung cancer mortality between provinces (MRR = 1.622) and  counties/districts (MRR = 1.447). On average, lung cancer mortality increased  over time and was positively associated with county-level urbanization (relative  risk (RR) = 1.15). Lung cancer mortality seemed to decrease in urban and increase  in rural areas. Compared to the northwest, mortality was higher in the north (RR  = 1.98), east (RR = 1.87), central (RR = 1.87), and northeast (RR = 2.44).  Regional differences and county-level urbanization accounted for 49.4% and 8.7%  of provincial and county variation, respectively. Reductions in lung cancer  mortality in urban areas may reflect improvements in access to preventive  healthcare and treatment services. Rising mortality in rural areas may reflect a  clustering of risk factors associated with rapid urbanization.","['Liu, Yunning', 'Astell-Burt, Thomas', 'Liu, Jiangmei', 'Yin, Peng', 'Feng, Xiaoqi', 'You, Jinling', 'Page, Andrew', 'Zhou, Maigeng', 'Wang, Lijun']",10.3390/ijerph13121252
"Trend analysis of lung cancer mortality and years of life lost (YLL) rate from 1999 to 2016 in Tianjin, China: Does the lung cancer burden in rural areas exceed  that of urban areas?","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine the trends in the mortality rate and years of life lost (YLL) rate of lung cancer in Tianjin, China, during the  period from 1999 to 2016. METHODS: Lung cancer death data were obtained from  Tianjin residents' all-cause death monitoring system, which covers the whole  population of Tianjin. Crude mortality rate, age-standardized mortality rate,  truncated rate (35-64 years), YLL and age-standardized YLL rate data were  calculated and trends examined. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2016, a total of 93 358  lung cancer deaths were reported in Tianjin, which accounted for 38.0% of all  cancer deaths (93 358/245744). The crude mortality rate of lung cancer had  increased 58.5% from 1999 (40.15/100000) to 2016 (63.64/100000), average annual  percent change (AACP) = 2.9%, P < 0.01. However, the age-standard YLL rate had  decreased to 13.3% in 2016 than in 1999, AACP = -0.8%, P < 0.01, with a stable  trend in males (AACP = -0.2%), and noticeable decreasing trend in females (AACP =  -1.4%). The lung cancer mortality rate (ASRW) in urban areas was higher than that  in rural areas in 1999, with a ratio of 1.99:1. However, it was lower in 2016,  with the ratio of 0.98:1. For the truncated rate (35-64 years), it had decreased  in urban areas compared with rural areas since the year 2013. CONCLUSION: Lung  cancer remains the most fatal cancer in Tianjin. However, the age-standard YLL  rate of lung cancer has decreased considerably accompanied by a decline in  smoking rate years ago, especially in women and people living in urban areas.  Considerable attention is therefore needed in the rural areas where cases of lung  cancer are still rapidly increasing.","['Zheng, Wenlong', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Shen, Chengfeng', 'Zhang, Shuang', 'Wang, Dezheng', 'Li, Wei', 'Jiang, Guohong']",10.1111/1759-7714.13314
Current Trends of Lung Cancer Surgery and Demographic and Social Factors Related to Changes in the Trends of Lung Cancer Surgery: An Analysis of the National  Database from 2010 to 2014.,"PURPOSE: We investigated current trends in lung cancer surgery and identified demographic and social factors related to changes in these trends. MATERIALS AND  METHODS: We estimated the incidence of lung cancer surgery using a procedure  code-based approach provided by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment  Service (http://opendata.hira.or.kr). The population data were obtained every  year from 2010 to 2014 from the Korean Statistical Information Service  (http://kosis.kr/). The annual percent change (APC) and statistical significance  were calculated using the Joinpoint software. RESULTS: From January 2010 to  December 2014, 25,687 patients underwent 25,921 lung cancer surgeries, which  increased by 45.1% from 2010 to 2014. The crude incidence rate of lung cancer  surgery in each year increased significantly (APC, 9.5; p < 0.05). The  male-to-female ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.6 (APC, -6.3; p < 0.05). The  incidence increased in the age group of ≥ 70 years for both sexes (male: APC,  3.7; p < 0.05; female: APC, 5.96; p < 0.05). Furthermore, the proportion of  female patients aged ≥ 65 years increased (APC, 7.2; p < 0.05), while that of  male patients aged < 65 years decreased (APC, -3.9; p < 0.05). The proportions of  segmentectomies (APC, 17.8; p < 0.05) and lobectomies (APC, 7.5; p < 0.05)  increased, while the proportion of pneumonectomies decreased (APC, -6.3; p <  0.05). Finally, the proportion of patients undergoing surgery in Seoul increased  (APC, 1.1; p < 0.05), while the proportion in other areas decreased (APC, -1.5; p  < 0.05). CONCLUSION: An increase in the use of lung cancer surgery in elderly  patients and female patients, and a decrease in the proportion of patients  requiring extensive pulmonary resection were identified. Furthermore,  centralization of lung cancer surgery was noted.","['Park, Samina', 'Park, In Kyu', 'Kim, Eung Re', 'Hwang, Yoohwa', 'Lee, Hyun Joo', 'Kang, Chang Hyun', 'Kim, Young Tae']",10.4143/crt.2016.196
The quality of life of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of non-small cell lung cancer chemotherapy on patients' health status, the occurrence of adverse  events and their effect on everyday activities, depending on the patients' sex  and age. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 62 non-small cell  lung cancer patients, (21 women and 41 men), aged 51-84 years, hospitalised due  to the chemotherapy. The survey included SF-20 test and a questionnaire prepared  by the authors. RESULTS: The most frequent adverse events indicated by the  patients were: weakness (79%), nausea and vomiting (77%), loss of appetite (56%)  and diarrhoea (45%). It was found that the side-effects of chemotherapy were not  dependent on age (p = 0.9882) or sex (p = 0.9968). The chemotherapy negatively  influenced the quality of the patients' life (p < 0.000001). It was shown that  there is a statistically significant correlation between age and limitations on  social roles, professional life and performing housework (p < 0.0133), and also  the inability to perform specific types of activities (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:  The results of the study show that chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer was  connected with decreased quality of life, especially in patients over 65 years of  age. The patients under 65 years of age could not deal with the disease in  respect of psychological aspects, whereas people over 65 years of age had greater  problems with physical, social and professional functioning.","['Karczmarek-Borowska, Bożenna', 'Pelc, Maria', 'Rabiej, Ewa', 'Grądalska-Lampart, Monika']",10.5603/PiAP.2014.0044
Generalisability of the results of the Dutch-Belgian randomised controlled lung cancer CT screening trial (NELSON): does self-selection play a role?,"The degree of self-selection in the Dutch-Belgian randomised controlled lung cancer screening trial (NELSON) was determined to assess the generalisability of  the study results. 335,441 (mainly) men born in 1928-1953 received a  questionnaire. Of the respondents (32%), eligible subjects were invited to  participate (19%). Fifty-five percent gave informed consent and was randomised.  Background characteristics were compared between male respondents on the first  questionnaire (n = 92,802), eligible subjects among them (n = 18,570) and those  randomised (n = 10,627) and Statistics Netherlands 2002-2005 (SN) (n = 5289) or  GLOBE study-data (Dutch cohort) (n = 696). Initial respondents were less likely  to be highly educated (OR(adj) = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74-0.96) and comprised of  significantly less current smokers (OR(adj) = 0.65; 95% CI: 0.61-0.69) compared  to the general population. These current smokers smoked more heavily (OR(adj) =  1.23; 95% CI: 1.10-1.37), but for a shorter time-period (respondents: 31, SN: 42  years, p < 0.001). Age, general health, BMI, alcohol use and cancer prevalence  were comparable. The randomised population was younger (Age 50-65) (randomised  subjects: 85.3%, SN: 72% (p < 0.01)) comprised of more heavy current smokers (OR  = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.75-2.44), that smoked for a shorter period of time (randomised  subjects: 37, SN_selection: 42 years (p < 0.001)). Both the respondents (32%) of  the first questionnaire as well as the randomised population of the NELSON trial  appeared to differ slightly on smoking characteristics, but the differences were  limited and probably balance each other. Results of the NELSON trial will be  roughly applicable to the Dutch and probably other populations that fulfil our  selection criteria.","['van der Aalst, C. M.', 'van Iersel, C.

"Factors affecting early morbidity and mortality in non-small cell lung cancer surgery, the experience of Surgical Clinic No. 1, Tg. Mureş.","INTRODUCTION: The incidence of lung cancer has increased alarmingly. Lung cancer represents the first cause of death in men. Thoracic surgery is engraved with  increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore, a rigorous selection of patients  undergoing such surgery is imposed. In order to establish the correct therapeutic  attitude,paraclinical explorations are of the ulmost importance. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study over a period of six  years. We used the casuistry of Surgical Clinic no. 1, Mureş County Emergency  Hospital. We studied the observation sheets of all the patients admitted in the  Surgical Clinic no. 1 over a period of six years (1th of January 2005 to the 31th  of December 2010). We studied 197 patients admitted to surgery in our clinic for  lung cancer. RESULTS: In the group studied, the majority of patients were in the  5th and 6th decade of life. The average age was 59.48 years. In our study group,  most patients were in an advanced stage of the disease, probably due to the late  stage diagnosis of lung cancer in general. The majority of the patients were in  the stage IIB and IIIA of disease. The overall postoperative morbidity rate was  21.82% (43 cases), In the study group we registered 8 deaths (4.06%)--it should  be noted that we considered in-hospital mortality within the first 30 days  postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: The main risk factors for postoperative  complications are: late age, male gender, pneumonectomy, low FEV1 value. Certain  risk factors are predictive of postoperative mortality. The most important of  them are: late age, male gender, type of surgery, FEV value, associated diseases  (especially cardiovascular and diabetes).","['Suciu, B.', 'Bud, V.', 'Copotoiu, C.', 'Brânzaniuc, Klara', 'Copotoiu, Ruxandra', 'Fodor, D.', 'Butiurca, V.']",
Time spans from first symptom to treatment in patients with lung cancer--the influence of symptoms and demographic characteristics.,"BACKGROUND: Cancer stage at diagnosis is the most important prognostic factor for lung cancer (LC), but most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease with many  and intense symptoms. This study explores relationships between LC patients'  first symptoms, symptoms triggering health care system (HCS) contact,  demographic/clinical characteristics, and time spans in the care trajectory from  first symptom(s) to treatment start. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records were  examined from all 314 patients diagnosed with primary LC in 2003 at a Department  of Respiratory Medicine, in Stockholm Sweden. Descriptive analysis was used to  examine symptoms and time spans in the care trajectory. Cox regression analysis  was conducted to explore the influence of symptoms and demographic/clinical  characteristics on the time spans. RESULTS: Tumor-specific symptoms led to HCS  visits to a greater extent than did systemic symptoms, despite reports of weight  loss, fatigue and appetite loss as common first symptoms. Minor differences  between women and men were found regarding specific symptoms. The study confirms  that the time spans from first symptoms reported to treatment start are  extensive, exceeding Swedish national recommendations. A lump/resistance,  neurological symptoms, appetite loss, hemoptysis and non-thoracic related pain  were associated with significantly shorter time spans in the care trajectory.  People >74 years old risked longer time span from first HCS visit to treatment  start. CONCLUSION: This study indicates a need for a more efficient LC care  trajectory. Elderly patients could be particularly vulnerable for longer time  spans.","['Lövgren, Malin', 'Leveälahti, Helena', 'Tishelman, Carol', 'Runesdotter, Sara', 'Hamberg, Katarina']",10.1080/02841860701592392
"Low socioeconomic status is a poor prognostic factor for survival in stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer and is independent of surgical treatment, race, and  marital status.","BACKGROUND: Racial minorities exhibit poor survival with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that generally is attributed to low socioeconomic status (SES). In  this study, the authors investigated the role of SES in this survival disparity  among patients with stage I NSCLC. METHODS: A case-only analysis was performed on  California Cancer Registry (CCR) data (1989-2003). Univariate survival analyses  were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate survival analyses were  performed using Cox proportional hazards ratios. RESULTS: In total, 19,702  incident cases of stage I NSCLC were analyzed. Low SES was identified more  commonly in African-American and Hispanic patients and was associated  significantly with men, unmarried status, stage IB disease, squamous cell  histology, poorly differentiated tumors, fewer surgical resections performed, and  less overall treatment received. Reasons for no surgery were associated strongly  with low SES and unmarried status but not with race. In multivariate analysis,  each incremental improvement in SES quintile was associated with statistically  significant decreases in the hazard ratios (HRs) for death (second SES quintile  [SES2] vs SES1: HR, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.85-0.98; SES3 vs  SES1: HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; SES4 vs SES1: HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.77-0.89;  SES5 vs SES1: HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.72-0.84; P(trend) < .0001). African-American or  Hispanic race was not an independent poor prognostic factor for survival after  adjustment for surgery, SES, and marital status. CONCLUSIONS: Low SES was an  independent poor prognostic factor for survival in patients with stage I NSCLC  and was independent of surgery, race, and marital status.","['Ou, S.-H.

"[Incidence, time trend, survival, and predictive factors of lung cancer in Shanghai populations].","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, survival, and influential factors of lung cancer in the Shanghai populations. METHODS: Data of individual cases of  lung cancer 2000 - 2004 were obtained from the Shanghai Cancer registry System.  The annual prevent change (APC) of incidence of lung cancer from 1972 to 2004 was  calculate by crude and standardized rates so as to analyze the time trends. Cox  proportional risk model was used to analyze the factors influencing the survival.  RESULTS: 23,196 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed 2002 - 2004. The crude  incidence rate of lung cancer in the females was 33.73/100,000, and the  age-adjusted rate was 30.90/100,000. The crude incidence rate of lung cancer and  the age-adjusted rate for the males were 81.65/100,000 and 33.73/100,000  respectively, both higher than those of females. The APC values of crude  incidence 2004 for both the males and females increased by 1.723% and 2.036%  respectively in comparison with the values 1972 (both P < 0.01). The age-adjusted  APC of standardized incidence rate for the males in the city center was -0.605%  (P < 0.01), showing a tendency to reduce; while the age-adjusted APC of  standardized incidence rate for the females in the city center was -0.136 (P >  0.05). The proportion of stage IV cases in the females was 47.5%, significantly  higher than that in the males (40.0%, P < 0.05). The proportion of adenocarcinoma  in the females was 86.1%, significantly higher than that in the males (47.8%, P <  0.05). The 3-year survival rate and median survival time of adenocarcinoma in the  females were 30.38% and 1.48 years respectively, both significantly higher than  those in the males (22.66% and 0.98 years, both P < 0.01). Female gender, being  younger, living in urban area, squamous cancer, early stage, visit to  higher-grade hospital were the factors beneficial to the prognosis of lung  cancer. CONCLUSION: The age adjusted incidence rate of lung cancer in Shanghai is  much closer to that of Western Europe and North America. The beneficial factors  for higher survival rate are female, younger age, urban residency, squamous cell  lung cancer, earlier stage of diagnosis, and higher grade hospital for treatment.  Women have statistically better outcomes than men in different stages of disease.","['Liao, Mei-lin', 'Chen, Zhi-wei', 'Zheng, Ying', 'Wu, Chun-xiao', 'Lu, Shun', 'Yu, Yong-feng', 'Jian, Hong', 'Cheng, Bai-jun']",
Emotions and lung cancer screening: Prioritising a humanistic approach to care.,"Low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening has mortality benefits. Yet, uptake has been low. To inform strategies to better deliver and promote  screening, in 2018, we interviewed 27 long-term smokers immediately following  lung cancer screening in Australia, prior to receiving scan results. Existing  lung screening studies employ the Health Belief Model. Reflecting growing  acknowledgement of the centrality of emotions to screening uptake, we draw on  psychological and sociological theories on emotions to thematically and  abductively analyse the emotional dimensions of lung cancer screening, with  implications for screening promotion and delivery. As smokers, interviewees  described feeling stigmatised, with female participants internalising and male  participants resisting stigma. Guilt and fear related to lung cancer were  described as screening motivators. The screening itself elicited mild positive  emotions. Notably, interviewees expressed gratitude for the care implicitly shown  through lung screening to smokers. More than individual risk assessment, findings  suggest lung screening campaigns should prioritise emotions. Peer workers have  been found to increase cancer screening uptake in marginalised communities,  however the risk to confidentiality-especially for female smokers-limits its  feasibility in lung cancer screening. Instead, we suggest involving peer  consultants in developing targeted screening strategies that foreground emotions.  Furthermore, findings suggest prioritising humanistic care in lung screening  delivery. Such an approach may be especially important for smokers from low  socioeconomic backgrounds, who perceive lung cancer screening and smoking as  sources of stigma and face a higher risk of dying from lung cancer and lower  engagement with screening.","['Olson, Rebecca E.', 'Goldsmith, Lisa', 'Winter, Sara', 'Spaulding, Elizabeth', 'Dunn, Nicola', 'Mander, Sarah', 'Ryan, Alyssa', 'Smith, Alexandra', 'Marshall, Henry M.']",10.1111/hsc.13945
Sex and Gender Differences in Lung Cancer and Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease.,"Two highly prevalent pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), show both sex and gender differences in their presentations and  outcomes. Sex differences are defined as biological differences associated with  the male vs female genotype, and gender differences are defined as behavioral or  social differences that primarily arise because of gender identity. The incidence  of both lung cancer and COPD has increased dramatically in women over the past 50  years, and both are associated with chronic pulmonary inflammation. Development  of COPD is also a risk factor for lung cancer. In this review, the main  differences in lung cancer and COPD biology observed between men and women will  be summarized. Potential causative factors will be discussed, including the role  of estrogen in promoting pro-growth and inflammatory phenotypes which may  contribute to development of both lung cancer and COPD. Response of the innate  and adaptive immune system to estrogen is a likely factor in the biology of both  lung cancer and COPD. Estrogen available from synthesis by reproductive organs as  well as local pulmonary estrogen synthesis may be involved in activating estrogen  receptors expressed by multiple cell types in the lung. Estrogenic actions,  although more pronounced in women, may also have importance in the biology of  lung cancer and COPD in men. Effects of estrogen are also timing and context  dependent; the multiple cell types that mediate estrogen action in the lungs may  confer both positive and negative effects on disease processes.","['Siegfried, Jill M.']",10.1210/endocr/bqab254
Derivation of utility values from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Core 30 questionnaire values in lung cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: Cancer clinical trials frequently incorporate quality of life (QoL) measures but rarely patient utility. Utility information is required for cost  utility evaluations of novel cancer therapies. We assessed the feasibility of  converting QoL data into utility scores using the European Organization for  Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life-Core 30 questionnaire (EORTC  QLQ-C30) and the EQ-5D in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  METHODS: Outpatients with all different disease states of NSCLC attending a major  Canadian cancer center completed the QLQ-C30 and EQ5D on a single visit. Results  of the QLQ-C30 summary scores were mapped to predict EQ-5D utility scores using  linear regression. Backward variable elimination using the Akaike Information  Criterion was used to reduce the full model that included all QLQ-C30 summary  scores to examine which QLQ-C30 dimensions best predict a patient's utility  score. To test the predictive power of the model, 10-fold cross-validation was  used. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients participated in the study. Median age of  the sample was 66 years (range, 32-85 years); 46.5% were men. The  cross-validation estimate of mean utility score was 0.76 (SD: 0.20), which was  the same as the actual mean utility score. Of the 15 QLQ-C30 dimensions, 4  functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, and social) and the pain  symptom dimension were predictive of patient utility scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our  study demonstrates the feasibility of deriving utility scores from prospective  QoL data. Validation of the QLQ-C30 predictors found in this study could further  the ability to estimate cost utility of therapies for economic evaluations.","['Jang, Raymond W.', 'Isogai, Pierre K.', 'Mittmann, Nicole', 'Bradbury, Penelope A.', 'Shepherd, Frances A.', 'Feld, Ronald', 'Leighl, Natasha B.']",10.1097/jto.0b013e3181f77a6a
International trends in lung cancer incidence by histological subtype: adenocarcinoma stabilizing in men but still increasing in women.,"OBJECTIVES: Trends in overall lung cancer incidence in different countries reflect the maturity of the smoking epidemic. Further understanding of the  underlying causes for trends over time can be gained by assessing the trends by  sex and histological subtype. We provide a temporal analysis of lung cancer  incidence in 12 populations (11 countries), with a focus on cohort-specific  trends for the main histological subtypes (squamous cell carcinomas (SCC),  adenocarcinomas (AdC), and small cell carcinoma). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We  restrict the analysis to population-based registry data of sufficient quality to  provide meaningful interpretation, using data in Europe, North America and  Oceania, extracted from successive Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Volumes.  Poorly specified morphologies were reallocated to a specified grouping on a  population, 5-year period and age group basis. RESULTS: In men, lung cancer rates  have been declining overall and by subtype, since the beginning of the study  period, except for AdC. AdC incidence rates have risen and surpassed those of SCC  (historically the most frequent subtype) in the majority of these populations,  but started to stabilize during the mid-1980s in North America, Australia and  Iceland. In women, AdC has been historically the most frequent subtype and rates  continue to increase in most populations studied. Early signs of a decline in AdC  can however be observed in Canada, Denmark and Australia among very recent female  cohorts, born after 1950. CONCLUSIONS: The continuing rise in lung cancer among  women in many countries reinforces the need for targeted smoking cessation  efforts alongside preventive actions.","['Lortet-Tieulent, J.', 'Soerjomataram, I.', 'Ferlay, J.', 'Rutherford, M.', 'Weiderpass, E.', 'Bray, F.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2014.01.009
Comorbidity Profiles and Their Effect on Treatment Selection and Survival among Patients with Lung Cancer.,"RATIONALE: Prior work has shown that the comorbidity burden is high among patients with lung cancer, but patterns of comorbid conditions have not been  systematically identified. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify distinct comorbidity  profiles in a large sample of patients with lung cancer and to examine the effect  of comorbidity profiles on treatment and survival. METHODS: In this retrospective  cohort study, we used latent class analysis to identify comorbidity profiles (or  classes) in a population-based sample of 6,662 patients with bronchogenic  carcinoma diagnosed between 2008 and 2013. We included specific comorbid  conditions from the Charlson comorbidity index. We used Cox proportional hazards  analysis to examine the effect of comorbidity class on survival. RESULTS: The  mean age of the patients was 70 years, and 50% were female, 34% were nonwhite,  and 17% were never-smokers. Most patients had stage III (21%) or IV (53%)  disease. Over half (51%) had at least one comorbid condition, whereas 18% had at  least four comorbidities. Latent class analysis identified five distinct  comorbidity classes. Classes were defined by progressively greater Charlson  comorbidity index scores and were further distinguished by the presence or  absence of specific types of vascular disease and diabetes. Comorbidity class was  independently associated with treatment selection (P < 0.001) and survival  (P < 0.0001), especially among patients with stages 0-II disease (P < 0.0001).  CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lung cancer can be described by distinct comorbidity  profiles that are independent predictors of treatment and survival. These  profiles provide a more nuanced understanding of how comorbidities cluster within  patients with lung cancer and how they can be applied for descriptive purposes or  in research.","['Gould, Michael K.', 'Munoz-Plaza, Corrine E.', 'Hahn, Erin E.', 'Lee, Janet S.', 'Parry, Carly', 'Shen, Ernest']",10.1513/AnnalsATS.201701-030OC
Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling of tobacco-related cancer mortality in Switzerland.,"Tobacco smoking is a main cause of disease in Switzerland; lung cancer being the most common cancer mortality in men and the second most common in women. Although  disease-specific mortality is decreasing in men, it is steadily increasing in  women. The four language regions in this country might play a role in this  context as they are influenced in different ways by the cultural and social  behaviour of neighbouring countries. Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal,  negative binomial models were fitted on subgroup-specific death rates indirectly  standardized by national references to explore age- and gender-specific  spatio-temporal patterns of mortality due to lung cancer and other  tobacco-related cancers in Switzerland for the time period 1969-2002. Differences  influenced by linguistic region and life in rural or urban areas were also  accounted for. Male lung cancer mortality was found to be rather homogeneous in  space, whereas women were confirmed to be more affected in urban regions.  Compared to the German-speaking part, female mortality was higher in the  French-speaking part of the country, a result contradicting other reports of  similar comparisons between France and Germany. The spatio-temporal patterns of  mortality were similar for lung cancer and other tobacco-related cancers. The  estimated mortality maps can support the planning in health care services and  evaluation of a national tobacco control programme. Better understanding of  spatial and temporal variation of cancer of the lung and other tobacco-related  cancers may help in allocating resources for more effective screening, diagnosis  and therapy. The methodology can be applied to similar studies in other settings.","['Jürgens, Verena', 'Ess, Silvia', 'Phuleria, Harish C.', 'Früh, Martin', 'Schwenkglenks, Matthias', 'Frick, Harald', 'Cerny, Thomas', 'Vounatsou, Penelope']",10.4081/gh.2013.82
Targeted Therapy Management in NSCLC Patients Using Cytology: Experience from a Tertiary Care Cancer Center.,"BACKGROUND: Although biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, cytological material has often been used to assist in making a pathologic diagnosis as well  as for molecular testing in certain cancers such as in the lung, cervix, and  head/neck. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to share experience from our institution  in the use of cytological material in screening for epidermal growth factor  receptor (EGFR) mutations in a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC). METHODS: Fine needle aspirates, pleural effusion, cell blocks of 223  NSCLC patients, where cytology suggested malignancy were screened for EGFR  mutation in exons 18-21 using Scorpion(®) ARMS real-time polymerase chain  reaction (PCR) technology. RESULTS: Overall, EGFR mutation was seen in 43.5 % of  study samples. Deletions were highest in exon 19 (27.2 %), followed by exon 21  (15.5 %), exon 18 (5.3 %), and exon 20 (1.9 %). Chi-squared analysis revealed a  significant correlation for mutation status in women compared with men (χ (2) =  5.88, p = 0.02), with exon 19 mutation predominating (χ (2) = 5.66, p = 0.02).  CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the successful use of cytology material for  molecular testing in a subset of NSCLC patients to direct their treatment.","['Veldore, Vidya H.', 'Patil, Shekar', 'Prabhudesai, Shilpa', 'Satheesh, C.

Analysis of the psychological impact of cancer-related symptoms on patients with non-small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) experience adverse physical symptoms because of cancer, cancer treatment, and comorbidities. The  relations among Cancer-Related Symptoms, Functional Impairment, and Psychological  Symptoms in patients with NSCLC is not well understood. METHODS: Retrospective  analysis of patient-reported symptoms with the 38-item Patient Care Monitor  survey, collected in routine clinical care for 1138 patients with NSCLC at eight  US community oncology practices. Study sample was randomly split, and structural  equation models examined the direct and mediated effects of Cancer-Related  Symptoms and Functional Impairment on symptoms of acute distress (Distress) and  depression (Despair) in the training sample. The training model was cross  validated in testing sample. Results are presented for the full model using the  entire sample. RESULTS: Patients were 48.3% female, with mean age of 66.0 years.  The most common comorbidities were anemia (60.8%) and respiratory disease  (24.5%). Severity of Cancer-Related Symptoms was strongly and positively related  to Functional Impairment and Psychological Symptoms in both training and testing  models. The modeled effect of Functional Impairment on Distress and Despair was  significant in the overall model using the total sample, and significant or  near-significant in the training and testing models. The mediated effect of  Cancer-Related Symptoms by Functional Impairment tended to be weaker than its  direct modeled effect on Distress and Despair. CONCLUSIONS: Despite prior  research suggesting that Functional Impairment plays a larger role than symptom  burden in depression in NSCLC, the independent modeled effects of Functional  Impairment were no greater than the direct modeled effects of Cancer-Related  Symptoms.

Uncertainty and psychological adjustment in patients with lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: For many patients with lung cancer, disease progression occurs without notice or with vague symptoms, and unfortunately, most treatments are not  curative. Given this unpredictability, we hypothesized the following: (1) poorer  psychological adjustment (specifically, more depressive symptoms, higher  perceptions of stress, and poorer emotional well-being) would be associated with  higher intolerance for uncertainty, higher perceived illness-related ambiguity,  and their interaction; and (2) greater avoidance would mediate associations  between higher intolerance of uncertainty and poorer psychological adjustment.  METHODS: Participants (N = 49) diagnosed with lung cancer at least 6 months prior  to enrollment completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale,  the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lung Emotional Well-being subscale,  the Perceived Stress scale, the Intolerance of Uncertainty scale, the Mishel  Uncertainty in Illness Scale Ambiguity subscale, the Impact of Event - Revised  Avoidance subscale, and the Short-scale Eysenck Personality Questionnaire -  Revised Neuroticism subscale. Mean age was 64.2 years (standard deviation [SD] =  11.0), mean years of education was 15.6 (SD = 3.1), and 71.4% were female.  Hypotheses were tested with regression analyses, adjusted for neuroticism.  RESULTS: Higher perceptions of stress and poorer emotional well-being were  associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty and higher perceived  illness-related ambiguity. Non-somatic depressive symptoms were associated with  higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty. Avoidance was found to mediate  relations of intolerance of uncertainty with non-somatic depressive symptoms and  emotional well-being only. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that interventions to  address avoidance and intolerance of uncertainty in individuals with lung cancer  may help improve psychological adjustment.","['Kurita, Keiko', 'Garon, Edward B.', 'Stanton, Annette L.', 'Meyerowitz, Beth E.']",10.1002/pon.3155
Lung cancer in Podkarpackie region in the years 2002-2011.,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer is one of the greatest challenges for modern medicine and in Poland the incidence and mortality rate are one of the highest. The aim of  the study was to assess trends in the incidence and mortality rate lung cancer in  the Podkarpackie province in the years 2002-2011. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 9993  cases (8018 men and 1975 women) and 8782 deaths (7211 men and 1571 women) of lung  cancer were analyzed. Crude rate and standardized coefficients of incidence and  mortality as well as stratum weight, and cumulative risk of incidence and  mortality were calculated. RESULTS: In 2011, in Podkarpackie province a decrease  number of lung cancer cases in men was observed compared to 2002 amounting to 195  case, but in women, an increase of 39 new cases was noted. Incidence rates in men  were in the range of 65.8-93.1/100,000, while in women they ranged  9.6-35.2/100,000. Mortality rates for males ranged from 59.2 to 82.8/100,000, and  in women from 6.1 to 29.0/100,000. Considerable diversity in incidence and  mortality in different districts of the province of Podkarpackie was observed.  CONCLUSIONS: In the years 2002-2011 the values of incidence and mortality rates  for men in Podkarpackie province were lower than the rates for Poland, in case of  women the same rates for Podkarpackie were almost two times lower than the rates  for Poland. In the years 2002-2011 the highest value of incidence and mortality  rate out of all districts of Podkarpackie Province was observed in the district  Lubaczów for men and in Przemyśl in case of women.","['Grądalska-Lampart, Monika', 'Karczmarek-Borowska, Bożenna', 'Radziszewska, Aneta Urszula']",10.5603/PiAP.2015.0018
Inhalative steroids as an individual treatment in symptomatic lung cancer patients with radiation pneumonitis grade II after radiotherapy - a single-centre  experience.,"PURPOSE: To assess efficacy of our single-centre experience with inhalative steroids (IS) in lung cancer patients with symptomatic radiation pneumonitis (RP)  grade II. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 05/09 and 07/10, 24 patients (female, n =  8; male, n = 16) with lung cancer (non-small cell lung carcinoma [NSCLC]: n = 19;  small cell lung cancer [SCLC]: n = 3; unknown histology: n = 2) and good  performance status (ECOG ≤1) received definitive radiotherapy to the primary  tumour site and involved lymph nodes with concurrent chemotherapy (n = 18),  sequential chemotherapy (n = 2) or radiation only (n = 4) and developed  symptomatic RP grade II during follow-up. No patient presented with oxygen  requiring RP grade III. The mean age at diagnosis was 66 years (range: 50-82  years). Nine patients suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  before treatment, and 18 patients had a smoking history (median pack years: 48).  The mean lung dose was 15.5 Gy (range: 3.0-23.1 Gy). All patients were treated  with IS. If a patient's clinical symptoms did not significantly improve within  two weeks of IS therapy initiation, their treatment was switched to oral  prednisolone. RESULTS: All 24 patients were initially treated with a high dose IS  (budesonide 800 μg 1-0-1) for 14 days. Of the patients, 18 showed a significant  improvement of clinical symptoms and 6 patients did not show significant  improvement of clinical symptoms and were classified as non-responders to IS.  Their treatment was switched to oral steroids after two weeks (starting with oral  prednisolone, 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight; at least 50 mg per day). All of these  patients responded to the prednisolone. None of non-responders presented with  increased symptoms of RP and required oxygen and / or hospitalization (RP grade  III). The median follow-up after IS treatment initiation was 18 months (range:  4-66 months). The median duration of IS treatment and prednisolone treatment was  8.2 months (range: 3.0-48.3 months) and 11.4 months (range: 5.0-44.0 months),  respectively. Of the 18 IS treatment responders, 2 (11.1 %) patients with  pre-existing grade 2 COPD still required IS (400 μg twice a day) 45.0 and 48.3  months after radiotherapy, respectively. For the remaining 16 responders (88.9  %), IS therapy was stopped after 7.7 months (range: 3.0-18.2 months). None of the  patients treated with IS developed any specific IS-related side effects such as  oral candidiasis. CONCLUSION: This single-centre experience shows that high-dose  IS is an individual treatment option for radiation-induced pneumonitis grade II  in patients with a good performance status.","['Henkenberens, C.', 'Janssen, S.', 'Lavae-Mokhtari, M.', 'Leni, K.', 'Meyer, A.', 'Christiansen, H.', 'Bremer, M.', 'Dickgreber, N.']",10.1186/s13014-016-0580-3
Post-operative radiotherapy in N2 non-small cell lung cancer: a retrospective analysis of 175 patients.,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post-operative radiotherapy (PORT) in radically resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has the aim to reduce loco regional recurrence  and to improve overall survival. PORT has been evaluated in several trials but  indication to post-operative treatment in N2 patients is still debated. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 175 patients treated at University of  Florence between 1988 and 2004 with completely resected NSCLC stages IIIA-IIIB,  N2 disease. Surgery consisted in a lobectomy in 58.9% and in a bi-lobectomy or in  a pneumonectomy in 41.1% of patients. One hundred and nineteen patients underwent  PORT and 56 patients did not receive PORT (no-PORT). RESULTS: At a median  follow-up of 27.6 months (range 4-233 months), we found a significant reduction  in local recurrence (LR) in PORT group (log-rank test p=0.015; HR: 0.45; 95%CI:  0.24-0.87). No statistical difference were found in terms of overall survival  (OS) (log-rank test p=0.92). Concerning other prognostic factors, male sex  emerged as statistically significant (HR:4.33;1.04-18.02) on local progression  free survival (LPFS) at univariate analysis. Acute and long-term toxicity was  mild. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective analysis showed that PORT may improve local  disease control in N2 NSCLC patients with an acceptable treatment-related  toxicity.","['Scotti, Vieri', 'Meattini, Icro', 'Saieva, Calogero', 'Agresti, Benedetta', 'de Luca Cardillo, Carla', 'Bastiani, Paolo', 'Livi, Lorenzo', 'Mangoni, Monica', 'Di Cataldo, Vanessa', 'Marrazzo, Livia', 'Rampini, Andrea', 'Cipressi, Samantha', 'Bruni, Alessio', 'Santini, Paolo', 'Biti, Giampaolo']",10.1016/j.radonc.2010.05.010
EGFR inhibitors: what have we learned from the treatment of lung cancer?,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the first molecular-targeted agents to be approved in the US and other  countries for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer after failure  of chemotherapy. Some patient characteristics, such as never-smoking, female  gender, East Asian origin, adenocarcinoma histology, and bronchioloalveolar  subtype, are associated with a greater benefit from treatment with EGFR  inhibitors. Recently, studies have identified gene mutations targeting the kinase  domain of the EGFR that are related to the response to inhibitors. Most EGFR  mutations predict a higher benefit from treatment compared with wild-type  receptors and are correlated with clinical features related to better outcome;  some EGFR mutations, however, confer drug resistance. The analysis of material  usually available from lung cancer patients, using techniques such as direct  sequencing to determine EGFR mutational status, can be technically challenging.  In this regard, high EGFR copy number and EGFR protein detected by  immunohistochemistry can also be used to select those patients who would benefit  from treatment. Prospective validation of biological and clinical markers of  sensitivity needs to be performed.","['Giaccone, Giuseppe', 'Rodriguez, Jose Antonio']",10.1038/ncponc0341
Global Epidemiology of Lung Cancer.,"While lung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related deaths for many years in the United States, incidence and mortality statistics - among other  measures - vary widely worldwide. The aim of this study was to review the  evidence on lung cancer epidemiology, including data of international scope with  comparisons of economically, socially, and biologically different patient groups.  In industrialized nations, evolving social and cultural smoking patterns have led  to rising or plateauing rates of lung cancer in women, lagging the long-declining  smoking and cancer incidence rates in men. In contrast, emerging economies vary  widely in smoking practices and cancer incidence but commonly also harbor risks  from environmental exposures, particularly widespread air pollution. Recent  research has also revealed clinical, radiologic, and pathologic correlates,  leading to greater knowledge in molecular profiling and targeted therapeutics, as  well as an emphasis on the rising incidence of adenocarcinoma histology.  Furthermore, emergent evidence about the benefits of lung cancer screening has  led to efforts to identify high-risk smokers and development of prediction tools.  This review also includes a discussion on the epidemiologic characteristics of  special groups including women and nonsmokers. Varying trends in smoking largely  dictate international patterns in lung cancer incidence and mortality. With  declining smoking rates in developed countries and knowledge gains made through  molecular profiling of tumors, the emergence of new risk factors and disease  features will lead to changes in the landscape of lung cancer epidemiology.","['Barta, Julie A.', 'Powell, Charles A.', 'Wisnivesky, Juan P.']",10.5334/aogh.2419
"Discussion of advance care planning on end-of-life decisions with lung cancer patients in Wuhan, China: attitude, timing and future directions.","BACKGROUND: Progress in advance care planning (ACP) in China has been hindered for decades compared with other countries. AIMS: To describe knowledge of ACP,  end-of-life (EOL) care preferences and the predictors of patients' preference for  ACP, as well as who should mention ACP among Chinese lung cancer patients.  METHODS: Questionnaire-based interviews were carried out. Two hundred and  fifty-eight lung cancer patients were recruited when first admitted to Tongji  Hospital from October 2017 to November 2018. Social-demographic factors, which  might influence patients' preference on ACP decisions and who should mention ACP,  were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total  of 91.1% (n = 235) of patients favoured ACP on EOL issues. One hundred and sixty  (60%) patients wanted to make EOL decisions on their own. Only 10% of patients  were familiar with advance directions. Eighty-two (31.8%) patients were familiar  with do not resuscitate/do not intubate (DNR/DNI) directions. ACP was not  mentioned in 92.2% of patients. Gender (male, OR = 4.87 (2.16-5.83)), tumour  stage (Stage III, OR = 0.108 (0.06-0.51); Stage IV, OR = 1.780 (1.02-2.11)) and  number of children (every increase in the number of children, OR = 0.267  (0.09-0.93)) were the significant predictors of preference for autonomous ACP.  Female patients and patients currently receiving treatment are 2.743 and 1.8  times, respectively, more willing to need ACP initiated by doctors. CONCLUSIONS:  Chinese patients showed preferences towards ACP, but with inadequate knowledge.  More assistance is needed with ACP for those patients, especially for females,  patients with one child and those with early stage lung cancer. For female  patients and patients receiving treatment, doctors may initiate ACP dialogue  first.","['Hu, Liya', 'Chu, Qian', 'Fan, Zeng', 'Chen, Yuan']",10.1111/imj.14958
Prognostic and Predictive Significance of PD-L1 Expression in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A Single-Center Experience.,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognostic and predictive value of PD-L1 expression in operated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and to analyze its  relationship with clinicopathological factors. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 90  patients with operable NSCLC were included in this retrospective single center  study. Tumor blocks of patients were stained immunohistochemically with PD-L1  polyclonal antibody. When evaluated immunohistochemically and statistically,  patients with tumor staining percentage of ≥5%, those with +2 and +3 membranous  staining intensity, and those with ≥50% H-Score were considered positive. The  relationship between PD-L1 expression status and clinicopathological features in  addition to the prognostic effect of PD-L1 on survival were statistically  analyzed. RESULTS: The frequency of PD-L1 expression was 37%, 15% and 5%  according to the staining percentage, staining intensity, and the H-Score,  respectively. There was no significant relationship between PD-L1 expression and  age, gender, smoking, tumor stage and histological subtype (p > 0.05). However,  PD-L1 expression was relatively higher in patients < 65 years of age, men,  smokers, patients with advanced tumor stage, and squamous cell subtype. Based on  the analysis of the H-Score, no significant difference was noted regarding  disease-free survival time between PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients  (median 20 [95% CI 1.2-38.7] months vs. median 27 [95% CI 17.5-36] months,  p=0.208). However, overall survival time was significantly shorter in PD-L1  positive compared to PD-L1 negative patients (median 24 months [95% CI 9.9-38]  vs. median 48 months [95% CI 33.6-62.3], p=0.049). CONCLUSION: In patients with  high PD-L1 expression, the biological behavior of the cancer was more aggressive,  and the life expectancy was shorter. PD-L1 expression seems to be a poor  prognostic marker in NSCLC patients.","['Arak, Hacı', 'Aytekin, Aydın', 'Canoz, Ozlem', 'Ozkan, Metin']",10.5146/tjpath.2021.01545
Quality Measures in Clinical Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Improved Performance Is Associated With Improved Survival.,"BACKGROUND: National organizations have recommended quality measures for operations in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The outcomes of  adherence to these guidelines are unknown. METHODS: Information about patients  who underwent an operation for clinical stage I NSCLC was abstracted from the  National Cancer Database. After reviewing current guidelines, the following  quality measures were selected: anatomic resection, operation within 8 weeks of  diagnosis, achievement of negative surgical margins, and sampling of 10 or more  lymph nodes. Multivariate models identified variables independently associated  with receiving quality measures and a Cox model created to evaluate overall  survival. RESULTS: Between 2004 and 2013, 133,026 of 133,366 (99.7%), 126,598 of  133,366 (94.9%), 91,472 of 133,366 (68.6%), and 30,041 of 133,366 (22.5%)  patients met one, two, three, or four measures. Income of at least $38,000/year  (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.24), insurance type (private insurance:  OR 1.22, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.36; Medicare: OR 1.16, 95% CI:1.04 to 1.30), centers  with at least 38 cases/year (OR 1.18, 95% CI: 1.14 to 1.22), academic  institutions (OR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.27 to 1.35), and clinical stage IB patients (OR  1.50, 95% CI: 1.40 to 1.60) were more likely to meet all four measures; whereas  increasing age (OR 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99 to 0.99), women (OR 0.93, 95% CI: 0.91 to  0.96), non-Caucasian race (OR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.79 to 0.87), and increasing  Charlson/Deyo comorbidity score (1: OR 0.90, 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.93; ≥2: OR 0.82,  95% CI: 0.79 to 0.86) were associated with lower likelihood. Pathologic upstaging  (hazard ratio [HR] 1.84, 95% CI: 1.78 to 1.89) and meeting all four measures (HR  0.39, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.48) were most powerfully associated with overall  survival. CONCLUSIONS: National adherence to quality measures in stage I NSCLC  resection is suboptimal. Guideline compliance is strongly associated with  survival, and vigorous efforts should be instituted by national societies to  improve adherence.","['Samson, Pamela', 'Crabtree, Traves', 'Broderick, Stephen', 'Kreisel, Daniel', 'Krupnick, A.

Observations in lung cancer over multiple decades: an analysis of outcomes and cost at a single high-volume institution.,"OBJECTIVES: This study reviews survival outcomes and cost of lung cancer care over multiple decades at a single high-volume institution. METHODS: All patients  with a diagnosis of lung cancer were analysed at a single institution from 1959  to 2010. Data were extracted from a tumour registry, which was linked to a  longitudinal medical record, clinical data repository and social security master  death index. In-depth survival analyses by stage were performed using  Kaplan-Meier methods from 1981 to 2010. The analysis contains hospital billing  data on 1025 lung cancer patients from 2004 to 2010. RESULTS: A total of 17 025  patients with lung cancer were identified over the study period. The 1-year,  5-year and 10-year all-cause mortality rates were 41, 78 and 87%, respectively.  Non-small-cell lung cancer comprised 73% (n = 12 361) of cases where the median  survival = 2.5 years and the population was 94% Caucasian. Lung cancer was most  prevalent between ages 60-79 years of life. Female gender and adenocarcinoma were  increasingly more prevalent over the decades. The 5-, 10- and 15-year survival  for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were 27, 15 and 5%, respectively.  Death rates measured at 1 year after diagnosis were reduced; however, 5-year  survival over each subsequent decade did not significantly change. In patients  where the full scope of cost data were available, the median cost/patient with  any stage NSCLC = $40 500, where 63% of the cost is expended in the first year  after diagnosis. The average length of treatment for NSCLC was 20.2 months. The  greatest single category of expense was chemotherapy (31%), followed by surgery  (24%), inpatient medical (17%), radiation therapy (12%) and diagnostics (5%). For  surgically treated patients, Stage II-IV costs were roughly twice those of Stage  I. CONCLUSIONS: There has been no evident improvement over the past 3 decades in  5-year survival (∼27%) in patients diagnosed with NSCLC at a single high-volume  institution. Improvement in 1-year survival is thought to be attributed to  improvements in diagnosing lung cancer earlier. Most of the healthcare  expenditure for lung cancer is incurred during the first year after diagnosis  despite stage.","['Lanuti, Michael', 'Hong, Hyo-Jung', 'Ali, Shihab', 'Stock, Cameron', 'Temel, Jennifer', 'Mathisen, Douglas', 'Michaelson, James S.']",10.1093/ejcts/ezt611
Volumetric PET parameters can predict overall survival in advanced lung adenocarcinoma.,"OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluates the prognostic value of metabolic parameters related to the primary tumor on pretreatment (18)F FDG PET/CT in  patients with advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This  retrospective study included 258 patients with advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma  who underwent pretreatment PET/CT scan, and for whom epidermal growth factor  receptor (EGFR)/anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status was available. The  maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV)  and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) related to the primary tumor at the baseline  PET and various clinical factors were recorded. The relation between these  factors and overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was  evaluated. RESULTS: The study included 258 patients with stage IIIB-IV lung  adenocarcinoma (72 female, 186 male, mean age 60.4±10.4 years), 210 of which died  and 243 of which progressed at the time of analysis. The median OS and PFS of the  patients were 16±1.9 and 5±0.5 months, respectively. The present study revealed  no significant relation between OS or PFS and gender, smoking status, presence of  distant metastasis, age and tumor size. There was no significant difference in  the OS and PFS of patients testing negative for EGFR mutations/ALK rearrangements  and those testing positive for both or either of the EGFR mutations and ALK  rearrangements. OS was significantly longer in patients with low MTV(p=0.011) and  those with low TLG(p=0.012) than high ones. However, no significant relation was  found between SUVmax and SUVmean values and OS, and between all PET parameters  and PFS. CONCLUSION: MTV and TLG reflecting the metabolic tumor burden can  predict OS in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma.","['Yanarateş, A.', 'Yazici, B.']",10.1016/j.remn.2019.09.004
"Outcomes for Thoracoscopy Versus Thoracotomy Not Just Technique Dependent: A Study of 9,787 Patients.","BACKGROUND: Studies reporting the benefits of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lung cancer resection over thoracotomy have been subject to  selection bias. We evaluated patient and hospital characteristics associated with  type of surgery and the independent effect of VATS on outcomes. METHODS: The  Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System of New York State database was  queried to identify all lung cancer patients undergoing lobectomy or sublobar  resection between 2007 and 2012. Multivariable logistic regression was performed  to identify patient (age, sex, race, comorbidities, year, and insurance) and  hospital (urban, teaching, and total lung surgery volume) cofactors associated  with surgical technique and propensity scores were used to evaluate whether  technique was independently associated with complications or in-hospital  mortality. RESULTS: There were 5,505 lobectomy and 4,282 sublobar resection  patients, with 2,318 (42%) and 2,416 (56%) undergoing VATS, respectively. For  lobectomy, VATS was associated with being female, lower comorbidity index,  private insurance, older age, surgery in recent year, nonteaching hospital, and  higher annual lung surgery volume. For sublobar resection, VATS was associated  with black race, lower comorbidity index, Medicaid or other insurance, surgery in  recent year, rural hospital, and higher annual lung surgery volume. Complication  rate was significantly lower for VATS lobectomy and not sublobar resection,  whereas in-hospital mortality was lower for VATS in both resection groups.  CONCLUSIONS: Numerous patient- and hospital-related variables that affect  morbidity and mortality also affect whether a patient undergoes VATS or open lung  resection. Studies evaluating VATS must account more accurately for selection  bias and adjust for these confounders.","['Wolf, Andrea', 'Liu, Bian', 'Leoncini, Emanuele', 'Nicastri, Daniel', 'Lee, Dong-Seok', 'Taioli, Emanuela', 'Flores, Raja']",10.1016/j.athoracsur.2017.09.059
Smoking status and the association between patient-level factors and survival among lung cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND: Declines in the prevalence of cigarette smoking, advances in targeted therapies, and implementation of lung cancer screening have changed the clinical  landscape for lung cancer. The proportion of lung cancer deaths is increasing in  those who have never smoked cigarettes. To better understand contemporary  patterns in survival among patients with lung cancer, a comprehensive evaluation  of factors associated with survival, including differential associations by  smoking status, is needed. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with lung cancer between  January 1, 2010, and September 30, 2019, were identified. We estimated all-cause  and lung cancer-specific median, 5-year, and multivariable restricted mean  survival time (RMST) to identify demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors  associated with survival, overall and stratified by smoking status (never,  former, and current). RESULTS: Analyses included 6813 patients with lung cancer:  13.9% never smoked, 54.2% formerly smoked, and 31.9% currently smoked. All-cause  RMST through 5 years for those who never, formerly, and currently smoked was  32.1, 25.9, and 23.3 months, respectively. Lung cancer-specific RMST was 36.3  months, 30.3 months, and 26.0 months, respectively. Across most models, female  sex, younger age, higher socioeconomic measures, first-course surgery, histology,  and body mass index were positively associated, and higher stage was inversely  associated with survival. Relative to White patients, Black patients had  increased survival among those who formerly smoked. CONCLUSIONS: We identify  actionable factors associated with survival between those who never, formerly,  and currently smoked cigarettes. These findings illuminate opportunities to  address underlying mechanisms driving lung cancer progression, including use of  first-course treatment, and enhanced implementation of tailored smoking cessation  interventions for individuals diagnosed with cancer.","['Carroll, Nikki M.', 'Burnett-Hartman, Andrea N.', 'Rendle, Katharine A.', 'Neslund-Dudas, Christine M.', 'Greenlee, Robert T.', 'Honda, Stacey A.', 'Vachani, Anil', 'Ritzwoller, Debra P.']",10.1093/jnci/djad098
The impact of the sequence of pulmonary vessel ligation during anatomic resection for lung cancer on long-term survival--a prospective randomized trial.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this prospective randomized trial was to assess the influence of the sequence of pulmonary vessel ligation, during anatomic resection, on long  term survival in patients with NSCLC. MATERIAL/METHODS: This prospective  randomized study included 385 patients treated surgically with lobectomy or  pneumonectomy and standard lymphadenectomy between 1999 and 2003. Patients were  randomly assigned to either primary ligation of the pulmonary artery or arteries  (group A - 215 patients) or of the pulmonary vein or veins (group V - 170  patients). Patients were excluded if the sequence of vessel ligation was affected  by technical difficulties or anatomic limitations. Univariate and multivariate  analyses included: the sequence of vessel ligation, age, gender, tumor histology,  stage (TNM), and cause of death (cancer related or non-cancer related). RESULTS:  Median follow-up was 63 months. The groups were comparable regarding gender,  histology, type of resection, and T, N, and overall stage. Overall, 5-year  survival reached 50% in group A and 54% in group V (p = 0.82) and did not differ  significantly in cancer related and non-cancer related deaths (p = 0.67 and p =  0.26, respectively). Univariate analysis identified higher T and N factors,  advanced stage, pneumonectomy, male sex, and older age as negative prognostic  factors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that age, T3-4 disease, and nodal  involvement were associated with inferior survival. CONCLUSIONS: The sequence of  pulmonary vessel ligation during anatomic resection for non-small cell lung  cancer does not significantly affect long-term survival.","['Kozak, A.', 'Alchimowicz, J.', 'Safranow, K.', 'Wójcik, J.', 'Kochanowski, L.', 'Kubisa, B.', 'Pieróg, J.', 'Grodzki, T.']",10.2478/v10039-012-0061-3
"Trends in lung cancer in elderly in Denmark, 1980-2012.","BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is an increasing problem in the older patient population due to the improvement in life expectation of the Western population. In this  study we examine trends in lung cancer incidence and mortality in Denmark from  1980 to 2012 with special focus on the elderly. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lung cancer  was defined as ICD-10 codes C33-34. Data derived from the NORDCAN database with  comparable data on cancer incidence, mortality, prevalence, and relative survival  in the Nordic countries, where the Danish data were delivered from the Danish  Cancer Registry and the Danish Cause of Death Registry with follow-up for death  or emigration until the end of 2013. RESULTS: In 2012, about 50% of lung cancers  were diagnosed among persons aged 70 years or more. For men and women older than  75 years the incidence rates have been increasing and for those aged 80-84 years,  the rates have doubled since 1980. Due to the poor survival, similar trends were  seen in mortality rates. Over the period, the one-year relative survival rates  almost doubled in patients aged 70 years or more, but still only 25% of the  patients aged 80-89 years survived their lung cancer for one year. CONCLUSION:  The incidence of lung cancer is closely linked to the pattern of tobacco smoking  with the differences between gender and age groups reflecting smoking behavior in  birth cohorts. Elderly patients with lung cancer are a heterogeneous group in  whom treatment should be offered according to comorbidity and a geriatric  assessment.","['Kristiansen, Charlotte', 'Schytte, Tine', 'Hansen, Karin Holmskov', 'Holtved, Eva', 'Hansen, Olfred']",10.3109/0284186X.2015.1114676
Survival with lung cancer in Finland has not improved during 2007-2019-a single center retrospective population-based real-world study.,"OBJECTIVES: According to the CONCORD-3 study, the 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients in Finland has not improved during the twenty-first century. In  the present study, we evaluated the survival trends of lung cancer patients  diagnosed and treated in one of the five university hospitals in Finland to  determine possible explanatory factors behind the lack of improved survival.  MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective population-based study included all lung  cancer patients diagnosed in Tampere University Hospital in 2007-2019 (N = 3041).  The study population was divided into two subcohorts: the patients diagnosed in  2007-2012 and those diagnosed in 2013-2019. The two subcohorts were then compared  to analyze the temporal changes in survival and the distribution of prognostic  factors. RESULTS: A comparison of the patients diagnosed in 2007-2012 and  2013-2019 showed that the patients' overall survival had remained unchanged. The  median overall survival was 8.7 months in the earlier subcohort and 9.2 months in  the later subcohort. The respective 5-year survival rates were 16.6% and 17.8%,  and these differences were not statistically significant. The proportion of stage  IV patients (approximately 59% in both subcohorts) and their risk of death were  similar for the two subcohorts. According to the regression analysis, male  gender, advanced stage, and poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance  status were independent risk factors for death, while a never-smoking status and  mutation-positive disease were associated with a decreased risk of death, but  only in the later cohort. CONCLUSION: Echoing the results of CONCORD-3, this  study confirmed that the real-world survival of unselected lung cancer  populations in Finland has not improved over the last 15 years, mainly because of  the unchanged proportions of patients with late-stage lung cancer. This calls for  earlier recognition of lung cancer, achieved by screening and increasing  awareness of the disease.","['Ahvonen, Jarkko', 'Luukkaala, Tiina', 'Laitinen, Tarja', 'Jukkola, Arja']",10.1080/0284186X.2023.2213444
Immunotherapy in advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer patients with poor performance status: The role of clinical-pathological variables and inflammatory  biomarkers.,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of immunotherapy has improved the prognosis of patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). However, data in poor ECOG  Performance Status (PS) patients remain scant due to their exclusion from  randomized trials. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed data of patients with  advanced NSCLC treated with immunotherapy in two Italian Centers, to evaluate the  impact of PS (0-1 vs 2) on disease control rate (DCR), progression free survival  (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Chi-square test was used to compare  clinical-pathological variables, their impact on survival was evaluated through  Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Among 404 patients included, PS was 0 in  137 (33.9 %), 1 in 208 (51.5 %) and 2 in 59 (14.6 %) patients; 143 were female  and 90 had squamous NSCLC. Clinical-pathological variables were uniformly  distributed except for higher prevalence of liver metastases in patients with  poor PS. We found that PS2 patients showed worse outcomes in terms of DCR (21.8 %  vs 50.3 %, p = 0.001), PFS [2.0 (95 % CI 1.6-3.0) vs 3.0 (95 % CI 2.7-4.0)  months, p < 0.0001] and OS [4.0 (95 % CI 2.8-5.7) vs 13.2 (95 % CI 11.0-15.8)  months, p < 0.0001]. PS2 status, negative PDL1 expression and early  corticosteroids exposure as well as higher Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and LDH  at baseline were associated with worse outcomes at univariate and multivariable  analysis. Subgroup analysis confirmed poor outcomes in PS2 patients with high LDH  and concomitant corticosteroid therapies. The incidence of Grade 3/4 adverse  events was 11.3 % in PS 0-1 and 10.2 % in PS 2 patients (p = 0.81). CONCLUSION:  Our data confirm reduced efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with poor PS even  though a good safety. Despite PS remains the most powerful independent prognostic  factor for NSCLC, LDH levels and steroids exposure could support the decision  making in PS2 patients.","['Lobefaro, Riccardo', 'Viscardi, Giuseppe', 'Di Liello, Raimondo', 'Massa, Giacomo', 'Iacovino, Maria Lucia', 'Sparano, Francesca', 'Della Corte, Carminia Maria', 'Ferrara, Roberto', 'Signorelli, Diego', 'Proto, Claudia', 'Prelaj, Arsela', 'Galli, Giulia', 'De Toma, Alessandro', 'Brambilla, Marta', 'Ganzinelli, Monica', 'Trevisan, Benedetta', 'Ciardiello, Fortunato', 'De Braud, Filippo', 'Morgillo, Floriana', 'Garassino, Marina Chiara', 'Lo Russo, Giuseppe']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2020.12.027
Bronchioloalveolar pathologic subtype and smoking history predict sensitivity to gefitinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.,"PURPOSE: Gefitinib, an inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase, induces radiographic regressions and symptomatic improvement in patients  with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase II trials suggested female sex and  adenocarcinoma were associated with response. We undertook this analysis to  identify additional clinical and pathologic features associated with sensitivity  to gefitinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records, pathologic  material, and imaging studies of all 139 NSCLC patients treated on one of three  consecutive studies of gefitinib monotherapy performed at our institution. We  identified patients experiencing a major objective response and compared their  clinical and pathologic features with the others. Univariate and multivariable  analyses were performed on potential predictive features associated with  sensitivity to gefitinib. RESULTS: Of 139 patients, 21 (15%; 95% CI, 9% to 21%),  experienced a partial radiographic response. Variables identified as significant  in univariate analysis included adenocarcinoma versus other NSCLC (19% v 0%;  P=.004), adenocarcinoma with bronchioloalveolar features versus other  adenocarcinomas (38% v 14%; P<.001), never smoker status versus former/current  (36% v 8%; P<.001), and Karnofsky performance status > or =80% versus < or =70%  (22% v 8%; P=.03). Multivariable analysis revealed the presence of adenocarcinoma  with any bronchioloalveolar features (P=.004) and being a never smoker (P=.006)  were independent predictors of response. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that  individuals in whom gefitinib is efficacious are more likely to have  adenocarcinomas of the bronchioloalveolar subtype and to be never smokers. These  observations may provide clues to mechanisms determining sensitivity to this  agent and suggest that NSCLC has a different biology in patients who never smoked  and those with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma.","['Miller, Vincent A.', 'Kris, Mark G.', 'Shah, Neelam', 'Patel, Jyoti', 'Azzoli, Christopher', 'Gomez, Jorge', 'Krug, Lee M.', 'Pao, William', 'Rizvi, Naiyer', 'Pizzo, Barbara', 'Tyson, Leslie', 'Venkatraman, Ennapadam', 'Ben-Porat, Leah', 'Memoli, Natalie', 'Zakowski, Maureen', 'Rusch, Valerie', 'Heelan, Robert T.']",10.1200/JCO.2004.08.158
Homeless Patients with Lung Cancer in Metropolitan Tokyo.,"Background Homeless persons are those who carry out their activities of daily living in city parks and other facilities. Little is known about homeless  patients with lung cancer in Japan. Therefore, we characterized the clinical  features and outcomes of homeless people in metropolitan Tokyo. Methods Between  January 2014 and August 2018, 2,068 homeless patients were admitted to the  homeless patient care unit at Tokyo Saiseikai Central Hospital. Of these, 13  patients were treated for primary lung cancer. We retrospectively analyzed the  patients' clinical characteristics, including their age, gender, treatment, and  outcome, obtained from the hospital's electronic medical records. Results A total  of 13 patients were treated for lung cancer. The median age was 66.2 (range,  51-77) years old. Twelve patients (92.3%) were smokers. All of the patients were  men and had advanced lung cancer. Of these, four patients had adenocarcinoma,  four had squamous carcinoma, and four had other histologies. Ten patients  received chemotherapy, and 3 received chemoradiotherapy (carboplatin, n=8;  cisplatin, n=2, immune check point inhibitor, n=2; other, n=1). Of the patients  on first-line treatment, 58% discontinued treatment, with 71% doing so willfully.  The median overall survival was 7.5 (1-44) months. During the study, nine  patients died in the hospital, and four were lost to follow up. Conclusion It is  difficult for homeless patients to continue chemotherapy, and they often quit  therapy willfully. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an education and health  insurance support system to ensure treatment continuity in a good social  environment.","['Oguri, Tomoyo', 'Sasada, Shinji', 'Shimada, Takashi', 'Ishioka, Kota', 'Takahashi, Saeko', 'Adachi, Tomohide', 'Nakamura, Morio']",10.2169/internalmedicine.6833-20
Clinical and Molecular Characteristics Associated With Survival Among Patients Treated With Checkpoint Inhibitors for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma: A  Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"IMPORTANCE: Checkpoint inhibitors have replaced docetaxel as the new standard second-line therapy in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), but little  is known about the potential predictive value of clinical and molecular  characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the relative efficacy of checkpoint  inhibitor vs docetaxel overall and in subgroups defined by clinicopathological  characteristics. DATA SOURCES: This systematic review and meta-analysis searched  MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials  for randomized clinical trials published in the English language between January  1, 1996, and January 30, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials that  compared a checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, or atezolizumab) with  docetaxel. For each trial included in this study, the trial name, year of  publication or conference presentation, patients' clinicopathological  characteristics, type of chemotherapy, and type of checkpoint inhibitor were  extracted. Data collection for this study took place from February 1 to March 31,  2017. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers performed study selection,  data abstraction, and risk of bias assessment. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CIs for  the overall population and subgroups were extracted. Pooled treatment estimates  were calculated using the inverse-variance-weighted method. RESULTS: In total, 5  trials involving 3025 patients with advanced NSCLC were included in this  meta-analysis. These patients were randomized to receive a checkpoint inhibitor  (nivolumab, 427 [14.1%]; pembrolizumab, 691 [22.8%]; or atezolizumab, 569  [18.8%]) or docetaxel (1338 [44.2%]). Checkpoint inhibitors were associated with  prolonged overall survival, compared with docetaxel (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.63-0.75;  P < .001). They prolonged overall survival in the EGFR wild-type subgroup (HR,  0.67; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75; P < .001), but not in the EGFR mutant subgroup  (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.80-1.53; P = .54; interaction, P = .005), and they prolonged  overall survival in the KRAS mutant subgroup (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.97;  P = .03) but not in the KRAS wild-type subgroup (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67-1.11;  P = .24; interaction, P = .24). The relative treatment benefits were similar  according to smoking status (never smokers [HR, 0.79] vs ever smokers [HR, 0.69];  interaction, P = .40), performance status (0 [HR, 0.69] vs 1 [HR, 0.68];  interaction, P = .85), age (<65 years [HR, 0.71] vs ≥65 years [HR, 0.69];  interaction, P = .74), histology (squamous [HR, 0.67] vs nonsquamous [HR, 0.70];  interaction, P = .71), or sex (male [HR, 0.69] vs female [HR, 0.70]; interaction,  P = .82). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Checkpoint inhibitors, compared with  docetaxel, are associated with significantly prolong overall survival in  second-line therapy in NSCLC. The finding of no overall survival benefit for  patients with EGFR mutant tumors suggests that checkpoint inhibitors should be  considered only after other effective therapies have been exhausted. The findings  of this meta-analysis could also assist in the design and interpretation of  future trials and in economic analyses.","['Lee, Chee Khoon', 'Man, Johnathan', 'Lord, Sally', 'Cooper, Wendy', 'Links, Matthew', 'Gebski, Val', 'Herbst, Roy S.', 'Gralla, Richard J.', 'Mok, Tony', 'Yang, James Chih-Hsin']",10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.4427
Impacts of lung cancer multidisciplinary meeting presentation: Drivers and outcomes from a population registry retrospective cohort study.,"INTRODUCTION: Multidisciplinary Meetings (MDM) are recommended in routine lung cancer care, however its broader impacts demand further evaluation. We assessed  the drivers and impacts of MDM presentation in the Victorian Lung Cancer Registry  (VLCR). METHODS: We examined the effect of MDM presentation on receipt of  treatment and survival in VLCR patients diagnosed between 2011 and 2020. We  compared patient characteristics, drivers of MDM discussion and survival between  the two groups. RESULTS: Of 9,628 patients, 5,900 (61.3%) were discussed at MDM,  3,728 (38.7%) were not. In the non-MDM group, a lower proportion received surgery  (22.1% vs. 31.2%), radiotherapy (34.2% vs. 44.4%) and chemotherapy (44.7% vs.  49.0%). Patients were less likely to be discussed if ≥80 years (OR 0.73,  p < 0.001), of ECOG performance status (PS) 4 (OR 0.23, p < 0.001), clinical  stage IV (OR 0.34, p < 0.001) or referred from regional (OR 0.52, p < 0.001) or  private hospital (OR 0.18, p < 0.001). MDM-presented patients had better median  survival (1.70 vs 0.75 years, p < 0.001) and lower adjusted mortality risk (HR  0.75; 0.71-0.80, p < 0.001), a protective effect consistent across all hospital  types. Undocumented PS, histopathology and clinical stage were associated with  lower likelihood of MDM discussion and worse mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In the VLCR,  being male, ≥80 years, of poorer PS, advanced clinical stage and poor clinical  characterisation significantly disadvantaged patients in relation to MDM  discussion. MDM-discussed patients were more likely to undergo treatment and had  a 25% lower risk of mortality. This study supports the use of MDMs in lung cancer  and identifies areas of inequity to be addressed.","['Lin, Tiffany', 'Pham, Jonathan', 'Paul, Eldho', 'Conron, Matthew', 'Wright, Gavin', 'Ball, David', 'Mitchell, Paul', 'Atkin, Nicola', 'Brand, Margaret', 'Zalcberg, John', 'Stirling, Robert G.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2021.12.006
"Patterns of survival and surgical treatment in lung cancer patients in Estonia by histologic type and stage, 1996-2016.","Background: Lung cancer (LC) remains the most frequent cause of cancer death worldwide. We aimed to examine long-term trends in LC survival in Estonia by age,  gender, histologic type and stage, with specific focus on surgical  treatment.Material and methods: Data on all incident cases of LC diagnosed from  1996 to 2016 were obtained from the Estonian Cancer Registry. Logistic regression  was used to examine receipt of surgical treatment in localized LC. Relative  survival ratios (RSR) were calculated, and excess hazard ratios (EHR) of death  were estimated by stage with gender, age, histology and period of diagnosis as  independent variables.Results: Among the total of 16,423 cases, squamous cell  carcinoma remained the most common histologic type. The odds of receiving  surgical treatment in localized LC increased significantly over time and were  associated with age, gender and histologic type. Overall, the age-standardized  5-year RSR improved significantly from 10% in 1996-2002 to 16% in 2010-2016 (from  8% to 15% in men and from 15% to 20% in women). Larger survival gain was seen in  younger patients, for non-small cell LC subtypes, and for surgically treated  patients. For localized disease, the 5-year RSR increased by more than 20  percentage units, reaching 50% in men and 69% in women. For all stages, the  adjusted EHR of death was significantly associated with age, histologic type and  period of diagnosis.Conclusions: We observed a substantial improvement of  relative survival, with considerable variations across patient groups. After  adjustment for age, gender and histology, a significant survival increase over  time was seen for all stages. The considerable survival gain observed for  localized LC can largely be attributed to rapidly growing proportion of  surgically treated patients. Further investigation of LC management practices,  particularly the use of non-surgical treatment options is warranted.","['Innos, Kaire', 'Oselin, Kersti', 'Laisaar, Tanel', 'Aareleid, Tiiu']",10.1080/0284186X.2019.1637539
Assessing the lung cancer comorbidome: An analysis of German claims data.,"OBJECTIVES: In presence of lung cancer, the additional impact of comorbidity on survival is often neglected, although comorbidities are likely to be prevalent.  Our study examines the comorbidity profile and the impact of distinct conditions  on survival in German lung cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We investigated  claims data from a large nationwide statutory health insurance fund of 16,202  patients initially diagnosed with lung cancer in 2009. We calculated the  prevalence of comorbidities grouped according to an extension of the Elixhauser  Comorbidity Index (EI). Effects of distinct comorbidities on 5-year survival were  examined using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for sex,  age and metastases at baseline. All analyses were stratified by initial lung  cancer-related treatment regimen (Surgery, Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy, No  treatment). Findings were visualized in the form of a comorbidome. RESULTS: Our  study population was predominantly male (70.6%) with a mean age of 68.6 years,  and a mean EI score of 3.94. Patients without treatment were older (74.4 years),  and their comorbidity burden was higher (mean EI = 4.59). Median survival varied  by subgroup (Surgery: 24.4 months, Chemotherapy/Radiotherapy: 8.8 months, No  treatment: 2.0 months), and so did the comorbidity profile and the impact of  distinct conditions on survival. Generally, the effect of comorbidities on  survival was detrimental and the negative association was most pronounced for  'Weight Loss' and' Paralysis'. In contrast, 'Lipid Metabolism Disorders' and  'Obesity' were positively associated with survival. Noteworthily, highly  prevalent conditions tended not to show any significant association. CONCLUSION:  We found specific comorbidity profiles within the distinct treatment regimens.  Moreover, there were negative but also some positive associations with survival,  and the strength of these effects varied by stratum. Particularly the positive  effects of 'Obesity"" and 'Lipid Metabolism Disorders' which were robust across  strata need to be further investigated to elucidate potential biomedical  explanations.","['Murawski, Monika', 'Walter, Julia', 'Schwarzkopf, Larissa']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2018.11.030
Smoking-attributable burden of lung cancer in the Philippines.,"BACKGROUND: In the Philippines, smoking is highly prevalent and tobacco control policies fail to fully implement the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control  provisions. To aid in policy change, intervention implementation, monitoring and  evaluation, this study aimed to provide the first internally consistent and  latest Philippine estimates of the following: disability-adjusted life-years  (DALYs) lost due to lung cancer; population-attributable fractions (PAFs) of  smoking; and smoking-attributable lung cancer DALYs. METHODS: This study applied  the Global Burden of Disease and Comparative Risk Assessment frameworks to  secondary data, supplemented by expert opinion. A comprehensive internally  consistent assessment of disease epidemiology was conducted using DISMOD II and  disease impact was quantified as DALYs. PAFs were calculated using the smoking  impact ratio and Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses were conducted. RESULTS: For  2008, lung cancer incidence and mortality estimates were 10 871 cases and 9871  deaths respectively. Lung cancer accounted for an estimated 267 787 DALYs lost,  99% of which were due to years of life lost. Overall, the PAF of smoking was 65%  and a total of 173 103 DALYs were smoking-attributable. There were increasing  trends in incidence, mortality and DALY rates with age. The majority of incidence  (72%), mortality (71%) and disease burden (72%) occurred among men, who also had  higher PAF estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable health gains could be achieved if  smoking exposure were reduced in the Philippines. Strong enforcement of measures  like increasing taxation to the WHO-endorsed rate, expanding smoke-free  environments, and requiring large graphic warnings within a comprehensive tobacco  control programme is recommended.","['Bilano, Ver Luanni Feliciano', 'Borja, Maridel P.', 'Cruz, Eduardo L.', 'Tan, Alvin G.', 'Mortera, Lalaine L.', 'Reganit, Paul Ferdinand M.']",10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2013-051082
Association of Adipopenia at Preoperative PET/CT with Mortality in Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Background Body mass index (BMI) and sarcopenia status are well-established prognostic factors in patients with lung cancer. However, the relationship  between the amount of adipose tissue and survival remains unclear. Purpose To  investigate the association between baseline adipopenia and outcomes in patients  with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Materials and Methods  Consecutive patients who underwent surgical resection for stage I NSCLC between  2011 and 2015 at a single tertiary care center were retrospectively identified.  The primary outcome was the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate, and secondary  outcomes were the 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate and the major  postoperative complication rate. The abdominal total fat volume at the waist and  the skeletal muscle area at the L3 level were obtained from preoperative PET/CT  data and were normalized by the height squared to calculate the fat volume index  (FVI) and skeletal muscle index. Adipopenia was defined as the sex-specific  lowest quartile of the FVI for the study sample, and sarcopenia was determined  using the skeletal muscle index reference value (men, <55 cm(2)/m(2); women, <39  cm(2)/m(2)). The association between body composition and outcomes was evaluated  using Cox regression analysis. Results A total of 440 patients (median age, 65  years [interquartile range, 58-72 years]; 243 men) were evaluated. Most  underweight patients (<20 kg/m(2)) had adipopenia (97%, 36 of 37 patients), but  overweight patients (25-30 kg/m(2), n = 138) and obese patients (>30 kg/m(2), n =  14) did not have adipopenia (3%, four of 152 patients). In the group with a  normal BMI (20-25 kg/m(2)), 28% (70 of 251 patients) had adipopenia and 67% (168  of 251 patients) had sarcopenia. After adjusting for age, sex, smoking history,  surgical procedure, stage, histologic type, BMI, and sarcopenia, adipopenia was  associated with reduced 5-year OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 3.8; P =  .02) and 5-year non-cancer-specific OS rates (HR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.2, 8.7; P =  .02). There was no association between adipopenia and postoperative complications  (P = .45) or between adipopenia and the 5-year DFS rate (P = .18). Conclusion  Baseline adipopenia was associated with a reduced 5-year overall survival rate in  patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer and may indicate risk for  non-cancer-related death. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available  for this article.","['Choi, Hyewon', 'Park, Young Sik', 'Na, Kwon Joong', 'Park, Samina', 'Park, In Kyu', 'Kang, Chang Hyun', 'Kim, Young Tae', 'Goo, Jin Mo', 'Yoon, Soon Ho']",10.1148/radiol.2021210576
Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with vinorelbine plus split-dose cisplatin may be an option in inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer: a single-center  experience.,"BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the current standard treatment for inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study we aimed  to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of CCRT with split dose of cisplatin (30  mg/m2) and vinorelbine (20 mg/m2) in patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC  followed in our oncology clinic. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records of 97  patients with inoperable stage III NSCLC treated with concurrent  chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin-vinorelbine were retrospectively analyzed.  Cisplatin (30 mg/m2) and vinorelbine (20 mg/m2) were administered on days 1, 8,  22, and 29 during radiotherapy. Two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy were  given. All patient data, including pathological, clinical, radiological,  biochemical, and hematological data, were assessed retrospectively using our  database system. RESULTS: Our study included 97 unresectable stage III NSCLC  patients who were treated with CCRT. Median age was 58 years old (range 39-75)  and 87 (89.7%) of the patients were men. ECOG performance score was 0-1 in 93  patients (95.9%). Squamous histology, the most common histology, was diagnosed in  46 patients (47.4%). Median follow-up time was 23.8 months. Median  progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival time (OS) were 10.3  months and 17.8 months, respectively. Objective response rate and clinical  benefit rate were 75.3% and 83.5%, respectively. Distant and local relapse rate  were 57.1% and 42.9%, respectively. Hematological and non-hematological grade 3-4  toxicities were seen in 13 (13.4%) and 16 (16.5%) patients, respectively. Six  (6.1%) patients died due to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study  suggest that split-dose cisplatin may offer fewer grade III-IV toxicities without  sacrificing efficacy and could be an option in patients with inoperable stage III  NSCLC during CCRT. Similar to past studies, despite high response rate during  CCRT, distant relapse is the major parameter that influences patient survival in  long-term in NSCLC.","['Mertsoylu, Hüseyin', 'Köse, Fatih', 'Sümbül, Ahmet Taner', 'Sedef, Ali Murat', 'Doğan, Özlem', 'Besen, Ali Ayberk', 'Parlak, Cem', 'Fındıkçıoğlu, Alper', 'Muallaoğlu, Sadık', 'Sezer, Ahmet', 'Sakallı, Hakan', 'Özyılkan, Özgür']",10.12659/MSM.892730
Lung cancer mortality in the wake of the changing smoking epidemic: a descriptive study of the global burden in 2020 and 2040.,"OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer death in 2020, responsible for almost one in five (18.0%) deaths. This paper provides an  overview of the descriptive epidemiology of LC based on national mortality  estimates for 2020 from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  and in the context of recent tobacco control policies. DESIGN AND SETTING: For  this descriptive study, age-standardised mortality rates per 100 000 person-years  of LC for 185 countries by sex were obtained from the GLOBOCAN 2020 database and  stratified by Human Development Index (HDI). LC deaths were projected to 2040  based on demographic changes alongside scenarios of annually increasing, stable  or decreasing rates from the baseline year of 2020. RESULTS: LC mortality rates  exhibited marked variations by geography and sex. Low HDI countries, many of them  within sub-Saharan Africa, tend to have low levels of mortality and an upward  trend in LC deaths is predicted for both sexes until 2040 according to  demographic projections, irrespective of trends in rates. In very high HDI  countries, including Europe, Northern America and Australia/New Zealand, there  are broadly decreasing trends in men whereas in women, rates are still increasing  or reaching a plateau. CONCLUSION: The current and future burden of LC in a  country or region largely depends on the present trajectory of the smoking  epidemic in its constituent populations, with distinct gender differences in  smoking patterns, both in transitioning and transitioned countries. Further  elevations in LC mortality are expected worldwide, raising important social and  political questions, especially in low-income and middle-income countries.","['Wéber, András', 'Morgan, Eileen', 'Vignat, Jerome', 'Laversanne, Mathieu', 'Pizzato, Margherita', 'Rumgay, Harriet', 'Singh, Deependra', 'Nagy, Péter', 'Kenessey, István', 'Soerjomataram, Isabelle', 'Bray, Freddie']",10.1136/bmjopen-2022-065303
Metronomic oral vinorelbine in a real-world population of advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"INTRODUCTION: An increasing body of evidence from clinical trials and real-world studies suggests that metronomic oral vinorelbine (VNR) is a promising treatment  option for elderly and unfit advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to present real-world data about  the experience in treatment of NSCLC with metronomic VNR in Portugal. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: Retrospective data from NSCLC patients not eligible for conventional  chemotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors who received oral metronomic VNR  irrespective of treatment line and dose was retrieved from 19 Portuguese Oncology  Centers between 2016 and 2018. RESULTS: A total of 293 patients were included,  with a median of 76 (39 - 94) years; 71% were ≥70 years old. Patients had a  median of 3 comorbidities and predominantly (61%) ECOG PS 2. Most (42%) received  metronomic oral VNR as first-line treatment. Overall response rate was 18%, with  42 (18%) partial and no (0%) complete responses. A total of 54% of patients  experienced stable disease and 28% of patients, disease progression. Disease  control rate was 72%. Patients were a median of 4 (1 - 40) months on treatment.  Treatment discontinuation was observed in 90%, mostly (67%) due to disease  progression, followed by death (16%). Adverse events leading to treatment  discontinuation were only reported in 5% of patients. Female gender (HR 0.601,  95% CI 0.434 - 0.832; p = 0.002) and ECOG PS 1 (HR 0.625, 95% CI [0.443 - 0.881];  p = 0.007) were significantly associated with a lower risk of metronomic oral VNR  discontinuation. Overall, 21% of patients experienced G3/4 toxicity. CONCLUSION:  The present real-world results agree with what has been previously reported by  other international Centers and support the concept that metronomic scheduling is  a relevant and safe approach to treat advanced NSCLC patients.","['Estevinho, Fernanda', 'Gomes, Rita', 'Hasmucrai, Direndra', 'Barata, Fernando']",10.1016/j.pulmoe.2020.09.003
County-level variation in the long-term association between PM(2.5) and lung cancer mortality in China.,"INTRODUCTION: The relative risk (RR) of long-term exposure to PM(2.5) in lung cancer mortality (LCM) may vary spatially in China. However, previous studies  applying global regression have been unable to capture such variation. We aimed  to employ a geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) to estimate the RRs  of LCM among the elderly (≥65 years) related to long-term exposure to PM(2.5) and  the LCM attributable to PM(2.5) at the county level in China. METHODS: We  obtained annual LCM in the elderly between 2013 and 2015 from the National Death  Surveillance. We linked annual mean concentrations of PM(2.5) between 2000 and  2004 with LCM using GWPR model at 148 counties across mainland China, adjusting  for smoking and socioeconomic covariates. We used county-specific GWPR models to  estimate annual average LCM in the elderly between 2013 and 2015 attributable to  PM(2.5) exposure between 2000 and 2004. RESULTS: The magnitude of the association  between long-term exposure to PM(2.5) and LCM varied with county. The median of  county-specific RRs of LCM among elderly men and women was 1.52 (range: 0.90,  2.40) and 1.49 (range: 0.88, 2.56) for each 10 μg/m(3) increment in PM(2.5),  respectively. The RRs were positively significant (P < 0.05) at 95% (140/148) of  counties among both elderly men and women. Higher RRs of PM(2.5) among elderly  men were located at Southwest and South China, and higher RRs among elderly women  were located at Northwest, Southwest, and South China. There were 99,967 and  54,457 lung cancer deaths among elderly men and women that could be attributed to  PM(2.5), with the attributable fractions of 31.4% and 33.8%, respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: The relative importance of long-term exposure to PM(2.5) in LCM  differed by county. The results could help the government design tailored and  efficient interventions. More stringent PM(2.5) control is urgently needed to  reduce LCM in China.","['Wang, Ning', 'Mengersen, Kerrie', 'Tong, Shilu', 'Kimlin, Michael', 'Zhou, Maigeng', 'Liu, Yang', 'Hu, Wenbiao']",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140195
Sequential afatinib and osimertinib in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and acquired T790M: A global non-interventional study (UpSwinG).,"BACKGROUND: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are standard of care for EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC). However, optimal sequence of treatment has yet to be defined. Overall  survival (OS) is influenced by the availability/use of subsequent therapy after  first-line treatment. Emergence of T790M is the main mechanism of resistance to  afatinib and second-line osimertinib could be a treatment option in this  instance. METHODS: In this non-interventional, global study (NCT04179890),  existing medical/electronic records were identified for consecutive EGFR  TKI-naïve patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC (Del19 or L858R) treated  with first-line afatinib and second-line osimertinib in regular clinical practice  (n = 191; all T790M-positive). The primary objective was time to treatment  failure (TTF). Key secondary objectives were OS and objective response rate  (ORR). RESULTS: At the start of afatinib treatment, median age (range) was  62 years (34-88). Fifty-five percent of patients were female and 67% were Asian.  ECOG PS (0/1/≥2) was 31%/57%/12%. Fourteen percent of patients had brain  metastases. At the start of osimertinib treatment, ECOG PS (0/1/≥2) was  25%/61%/14% and 14% had brain metastases (rising to 29% at the end of osimertinib  treatment). The source of biopsy material (solid/liquid) was 86%/3% at the start  of afatinib and 54%/33% at start of osimertinib. Mutations were mainly detected  with PCR methods. Overall, median TTF was 27.7 months (95% CI: 24.0-30.2) and  median OS was 36.5 months (95% CI: 32.9-41.8). ORR with afatinib and osimertinib  was 74% and 45%. TTF, OS and ORR were generally consistent across subgroups.  CONCLUSION: Sequential afatinib and osimertinib demonstrated encouraging activity  in patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and acquired T790M. Activity was  observed across all subgroups, including patients with poor ECOG PS or brain  metastases. ECOG PS and incidence of brain metastases remained stable prior to,  and after, afatinib treatment.","['Popat, Sanjay', 'Jung, Hyun Ae', 'Lee, Shin Yup', 'Hochmair, Maximilian J.', 'Lee, Seung Hyeun', 'Escriu, Carles', 'Lee, Min Ki', 'Migliorino, Maria R.', 'Lee, Yong Chul', 'Girard, Nicolas', 'Daoud, Hasan', 'Märten, Angela', 'Miura, Satoru']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2021.09.009
Randomized phase II trial comparing twice daily hyperfractionated with once daily hypofractionated thoracic radiotherapy in limited disease small cell lung cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemotherapy and thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) is recommended for limited disease small cell lung cancer (LD SCLC). Twice daily TRT  is well documented, but not universally implemented - probably mainly due to  inconvenience and concerns about toxicity. A schedule of three-week  hypofractionated TRT is a commonly used alternative. This is the first randomized  trial comparing twice daily and hypofractionated TRT in LD SCLC. MATERIAL AND  METHODS: Patients received four courses of cisplatin/etoposide (PE) and were  randomized to TRT of 42 Gy in 15 fractions (once daily, OD) or 45 Gy in 30  fractions (twice daily, BID) between the second and third PE course. Good  responders received prophylactic cranial irradiation of 30 Gy in 15 fractions.  RESULTS: 157 patients were enrolled between May 2005 and January 2011 (OD:  n = 84, BID: n = 73). Median age was 63 years, 52% were men, 84% had performance  status 0-1, 72% had stage III disease and 11% non-malignant pleural effusion. The  treatment arms were well balanced. The response rates were similar (OD: 92%, BID:  88%; p = 0.41), but more BID patients achieved a complete response (OD: 13%, BID:  33%; p = 0.003). There was no difference in one-year progression-free survival  (PFS) (OD: 45%, BID: 49%; p = 0.61) or median PFS (OD: 10.2 months, BID: 11.4  months; p = 0.93). The median overall survival in the BID arm was 6.3 months  longer (OD: 18.8 months, BID: 25.1 months; p = 0.61). There were no differences  in grade 3-4 esophagitis (OD: 31%, BID: 33%, p = 0.80) or pneumonitis (OD: 2%,  BID: 3%, p = 1.0). Patients on the BID arm reported slightly more dysphagia at  the end of the TRT. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in severe toxicity  between the two TRT schedules. The twice daily schedule resulted in significantly  more complete responses and a numerically longer median overall survival, but no  firm conclusions about efficacy could be drawn from this phase II trial.","['Grønberg, Bjørn H.', 'Halvorsen, Tarje O.', 'Fløtten, Øystein', 'Brustugun, Odd T.', 'Brunsvig, Paal F.', 'Aasebø, Ulf', 'Bremnes, Roy M.', 'Tollåli, Terje', 'Hornslien, Kjersti', 'Aksnessæther, Bjørg Y.', 'Liaaen, Erik D.', 'Sundstrøm, Stein']",10.3109/0284186X.2015.1092584
"Similarities and Differences Between Sexes and Countries in the Mortality Imprint of the Smoking Epidemic in 34 Low-Mortality Countries, 1950-2014.","INTRODUCTION: The smoking epidemic greatly affected mortality levels and trends, especially among men in low-mortality countries. The objective of this article  was to examine similarities and differences between sexes and low-mortality  countries in the mortality imprint of the smoking epidemic. This will provide  important additions to the smoking epidemic model, but also improve our  understanding of the differential impact of the smoking epidemic, and provide  insights into its future impact. METHODS: Using lung-cancer mortality data for 30  European and four North American or Australasian countries, smoking-attributable  mortality fractions (SAMF) by sex, age (35-99), and year (1950-2014) were  indirectly estimated. The timing and level of the peak in SAMF35-99, estimated  using weighting and smoothing, were compared. RESULTS: Among men in all countries  except Bulgaria, a clear wave pattern was observed, with SAMF35-99 peaking, on  average, at 33.4% in 1986. Eastern European men experienced the highest (40%) and  Swedish men the lowest (16%) peak. Among women, SAMF35-99 peaked, on average, at  18.1% in 2007 in the North American/Australasian countries and five Northwestern  European countries, and increased, on average, to 7.5% in 2014 in the remaining  countries (4% in Southern and Eastern Europe). The average sex difference in the  peak is at least 25.6 years in its timing and at most 22.9 percentage points in  its level. CONCLUSIONS: Although the progression of smoking-attributable  mortality in low-mortality countries was similar, there are important unexpected  sex and country differences in the maximum mortality impact of the smoking  epidemic driven by cross-country differences in economic, political, and  emancipatory progress. IMPLICATIONS: The formal, systematic, and comprehensive  analysis of similarities and differences between sexes and 34 low-mortality  countries in long-term time trends (1950-2014) in smoking-attributable mortality  provided important additions to the Global Burden of Disease study and the  descriptive smoking epidemic model (Lopez et al.). Despite a general increase  followed by a decline, the timing of the maximum mortality impact differs more  between sexes than previously anticipated, but less between regions. The maximum  mortality impact among men differs considerably between countries. The observed  substantial diversity warrants country-specific tobacco control interventions and  increased attention to the current or expected higher smoking-attributable  mortality shares among women compared to men.","['Janssen, Fanny']",10.1093/ntr/ntz154
Likely uptake of a future a lung cancer screening programme in Hodgkin lymphoma survivors: a questionnaire study.,"BACKGROUND: Many Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors are at increased risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN), including lung cancer, due to previous  treatment for HL. Lung cancer screening (LCS) detects early-stage lung cancers in  ever smokers but HL survivors without a heavy smoking history are ineligible for  screening. There is a rationale to develop a targeted LCS. The aim of this study  was to investigate levels of willingness to undergo LCS in HL survivors, and to  identify the psycho-social factors associated with screening hesitancy. METHODS:  A postal questionnaire was sent to 281 HL survivors registered in a long-term  follow-up database and at increased risk of SMNs. Demographic, lung cancer risk  factors, psycho-social and LCS belief variables were measured. Multivariable  logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated  with lung cancer screening hesitancy, defined as those who would 'probably' or  'probably not' participate. RESULTS: The response rate to the questionnaire was  58% (n = 165). Participants were more likely to be female, older and living in a  less deprived area than non-participants. Uptake (at any time) of breast and  bowel cancer screening among those previously invited was 99% and 77%  respectively. 159 participants were at excess risk of lung cancer. The following  results refer to these 159. Around half perceived themselves to be at greater  risk of lung cancer than their peers. Only 6% were eligible for lung cancer  screening pilots aimed at ever smokers in the UK. 98% indicated they would  probably or definitely participate in LCS were it available. Psycho-social  variables associated with LCS hesitancy on multivariable analysis were male  gender (OR 5.94 CI 1.64-21.44, p < 0.01), living in an area with a high index of  multiple deprivation decile (deciles 6-10) (OR 8.22 CI 1.59-42.58, p < 0.05) and  lower levels of self-efficacy (OR 1.64 CI 1.30-2.08 p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: HL  survivors responding to this survey were willing to participate in a future LCS  programme but there was some hesitancy. A future LCS trial for HL survivors  should consider the factors associated with screening hesitancy in order to  minimise barriers to participation.","['Broadbent, Rachel', 'Armitage, Christopher J.', 'Crosbie, Philip', 'Radford, John', 'Linton, Kim']",10.1186/s12890-022-01959-3
Differences in smoking prevalence and eligibility for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening among older U.S. adults: role of sexual  orientation.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the past-year prevalence estimates of cigarette smoking and eligibility for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung  cancer screening among older U.S. adults and examine potential variations in  these estimates by sexual orientation. Data were from the 2012-2013 National  Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III) and included  in-person interviews with a nationally representative sample of  non-institutionalized adults aged 18 and older. Eligibility for LDCT was based on  U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines. Analyses  included participants aged 55-77 (n = 9,635). Overall, 17.5% of older adult  respondents reported past-year smoking. Overall rates of past-year cigarette  smoking were influenced by sex and sexual orientation with males reporting higher  rates compared to females. Among both males and females, smoking was most  prevalent among bisexual individuals. Eligibility for LDCT was also higher among  males compared to females and among bisexually identified adults relative to  homosexual and heterosexual-identified adults. Overall, 11.2% of older U.S.  adults met eligibility for LDCT lung cancer screening. Eligibility for LDCT lung  screening is associated with sexual orientation; the highest rates of eligibility  are among bisexual women and men (26.9 and 24.5%, respectively). The current  study found variations in cigarette smoking and eligibility for LDCT lung cancer  screening (a proxy for chronic high-risk smoking) among older U.S. adults based  on sexual orientation. Efforts to increase screening should take into account  these differences.","['Matthews, Alicia K.', 'McCabe, Sean Esteban', 'Lee, Joseph G. L.', 'Veliz, Phil']",10.1007/s10552-018-1044-x
Long-term clinical benefit from salvage EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients with EGFR wild-type tumors.,"BACKGROUND: Erlotinib has been approved for the management of NSCLC patients after failure of the first or subsequent line of chemotherapy. Although the  efficacy of erlotinib is clearly associated with the presence of EGFR mutations,  there is a subset of patients with EGFR wild-type (EGFRwt) tumors who  impressively respond. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with EGFRwt NSCLC who  received salvage (≥2nd line) treatment with erlotinib for a prolonged period  (>6 months), were sought from the database of the Hellenic Oncology Research  Group. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical, pathological and molecular  characteristics of the patients with available tumor material. RESULTS:  Forty-four patients that received erlotinib for >6 months (median 10.1 months)  were enrolled in the study. The majority of them were male, never-smokers with  adenocarcinoma histology and a good performance status. KRAS and PIK3CA mutations  were detected in 21% (9/42 tested) and 13% (4/30 tested) of the patients,  respectively. The ALK-EML4 translocation was found in 10% (2/20 tested); there  was no patient with HER2 or BRAF mutated tumor. Twelve (54.5%) tumor specimens  were considered positive for EGFR-overexpression. Eleven patients experienced a  partial response (objective response rate 25%; 95% CI 12-38%) and the remaining  33 had stable disease. The median progression-free survival and overall survival  were 10.1 (95% CI 8.6-11.6 months) and 24.1 (95% CI 11.2-37 months),  respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with erlotinib significantly improves the  clinical outcome in a subset of NSCLC patients with EGFRwt tumors. Further  molecular analysis of such tumor specimens could provide a more comprehensive  characterization of this particular group of patients. Nevertheless, the presence  of other mutations should not prevent the treating physician from using erlotinib  at later lines of salvage therapy for NSCLC patients.","['Koinis, F.', 'Voutsina, A.', 'Kalikaki, A.', 'Koutsopoulos, A.', 'Lagoudaki, E.', 'Tsakalaki, E.', 'Dermitzaki, E.

Major changes in lung cancer over the last ten years in France: the KBP-CPHG studies.,"The incidence of lung cancer has dramatically increased in ten years, being now the most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the fourth most commonly  diagnosed cancer in females. Considering social and scientific evolution, the aim  of the present study conducted by the French College of General Hospital  Respiratory Physicians (CPHG) was to compare patient and lung cancer  characteristics at a ten-year interval. Two epidemiological studies,  KBP-2000-CPHG and KBP-2010-CPHG, were conducted at a ten-year interval. These  prospective multicentre studies included all patients ≥ 18 years of age with  primary lung cancer diagnosed between 1st January and 31st December 2000 or 2010,  and managed in the respiratory departments of one of the participating general  hospitals. A standardised form was completed for each patient. A steering  committee checked recruitment exhaustiveness. Respectively, in 2000 and 2010, 137  and 104 centres included 5667 and 7051 patients. Compared to 2000, patients in  2010 were significantly older (65.5 ± 11.3 vs. 64.3 ± 11.5 years, p < 0.0001),  more frequently women (24.3% vs. 16.0%, p < 0.0001) and never-smokers (10.9% vs.  7.2%, p < 0.0001). In 2010, adenocarcinoma was the most common tumour (45.4%, vs.  29.0% in 2000, p < 0.0001). The adenocarcinoma rate increased irrespective of  sex, age, or smoking status (relative risk [RR] before and after adjustment, RR =  2.07 [1.92-2.24], p < 0.0001 and 2.06 [1.90-2.23], p < 0.0001). In ten years,  lung cancer characteristics have therefore changed: more women, more  never-smokers, and more adenocarcinomas. The particular high increase in  adenocarcinoma rate deserves further analysis.","['Locher, Chrystèle', 'Debieuvre, Didier', 'Coëtmeur, Daniel', 'Goupil, François', 'Molinier, Olivier', 'Collon, Thierry', 'Dayen, Charles', 'Le Treut, Jacques', 'Asselain, Bernard', 'Martin, Francis', 'Blanchon, François', 'Grivaux, Michel']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2013.03.001
Deep Learning to Optimize Candidate Selection for Lung Cancer CT Screening: Advancing the 2021 USPSTF Recommendations.,"Background A deep learning (DL) model to identify lung cancer screening candidates based on their chest radiographs requires external validation with a  recent real-world non-U.S. sample. Purpose To validate the DL model and identify  added benefits to the 2021 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF)  recommendations in a health check-up sample. Materials and Methods This  single-center retrospective study included consecutive current and former smokers  aged 50-80 years who underwent chest radiography during a health check-up between  January 2004 and June 2018. Discrimination performance, including receiver  operating characteristic curve analysis and area under the receiver operating  characteristic curve (AUC) calculation, of the model for incident lung cancers  was evaluated. The added value of the model to the 2021 USPSTF recommendations  was investigated for lung cancer inclusion rate, proportion of selected CT  screening candidates, and positive predictive value (PPV). Results For model  validation, a total of 19 488 individuals (mean age, 58 years ± 6 [SD]; 18 467  [95%] men) and the subset of USPSTF-eligible individuals (n = 7835; mean age, 57  years ± 6; 7699 [98%] men) were assessed, and the AUCs for incident lung cancers  were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.73) and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.81), respectively. In  individuals with pack-year information (n = 17 390), when excluding low- and  indeterminate-risk categories from the USPSTF-eligible sample, the proportion of  selected CT screening candidates was reduced to 35.8% (6233 of 17 390) from 45.1%  (7835 of 17 390, P < .001), with three missed lung cancers (0.2%). The cancer  inclusion rate (0.3% [53 of 17 390] vs 0.3% [56 of 17 390], P = .85) and PPV  (0.9% [53 of 6233] vs 0.7% [56 of 7835], P = .42) remained unaffected. Conclusion  An externally validated deep learning model showed the added value to the 2021  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations for low-dose CT lung cancer  screening in reducing the number of screening candidates while maintaining the  inclusion rate and positive predictive value for incident lung cancer. © RSNA,  2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","['Lee, Jong Hyuk', 'Lee, Dongheon', 'Lu, Michael T.', 'Raghu, Vineet K.', 'Park, Chang Min', 'Goo, Jin Mo', 'Choi, Seung Ho', 'Kim, Hyungjin']",10.1148/radiol.212877
Early Phase I Study of a (99m)Tc-Labeled Anti-Programmed Death Ligand-1 (PD-L1) Single-Domain Antibody in SPECT/CT Assessment of PD-L1 Expression in Non-Small  Cell Lung Cancer.,"Immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibodies demonstrates improvements in treatment of  advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment stratification depends on  immunohistochemical PD-L1 measurement of biopsy material, an invasive method that  does not account for spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Using a single-domain  antibody, NM-01, against PD-L1, radiolabeled site-specifically with (99m)Tc for  SPECT imaging, we aimed to assess the safety, radiation dosimetry, and imaging  characteristics of this radiopharmaceutical and correlate tumor uptake with PD-L1  immunohistochemistry results. Methods: Sixteen patients (mean age, 61.7 y; 11  men) with non-small cell lung cancer were recruited. Primary tumor PD-L1  expression was measured by immunohistochemistry. NM-01 was radiolabeled with  [(99m)Tc(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)](+) complex binding to its C-terminal hexahistidine  tag. Administered activity was 3.8-10.4 MBq/kg, corresponding to 100 μg or 400 μg  of NM-01. Whole-body planar and thoracic SPECT/CT scans were obtained at 1 and 2  h after injection in all patients, and 5 patients underwent additional imaging at  10 min, 3 h, and 24 h for radiation dosimetry calculations. All patients were  monitored for adverse events. Results: No drug-related adverse events occurred in  this study. The mean effective dose was 8.84 × 10(-3) ± 9.33 × 10(-4) mSv/MBq  (3.59 ± 0.74 mSv per patient). Tracer uptake was observed in the kidneys, spleen,  liver, and bone marrow. SPECT primary tumor-to-blood-pool ratios (T:BP) varied  from 1.24 to 2.3 (mean, 1.79) at 1 h and 1.24 to 3.53 (mean, 2.22) at 2 h (P =  0.005). Two-hour primary T:BP ratios correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry  results (r = 0.68, P = 0.014). Two-hour T:BP was lower in tumors with ≤1% PD-L1  expression (1.89 vs. 2.49, P = 0.048). Nodal and bone metastases showed tracer  uptake. Heterogeneity (>20%) between primary tumor and nodal T:BP was present in  4 of 13 patients. Conclusion: This first-in-human study demonstrates that  (99m)Tc-labeled anti-PD-L1-single-domain antibody SPECT/CT imaging is safe and  associated with acceptable dosimetry. Tumor uptake is readily visible against  background tissues, particularly at 2 h when the T:BP ratio correlates with PD-L1  immunohistochemistry results.","['Xing, Yan', 'Chand, Gitasha', 'Liu, Changchun', 'Cook, Gary J.

Midterm changes in quality of life: a prospective evaluation after open pulmonary metastasectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary metastasectomy has gained the status of a standard treatment for oligometastases of various primaries. Given that the consequences  for quality of life (QoL) remain unclear, we initiated this study to characterize  the therapy-induced effects of pulmonary metastasectomy on QoL. METHODS: From  2008 to 2010, patients scheduled for metastasectomy were prospectively evaluated  using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of  Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the lung cancer module (LC13)  questionnaire and again 3 months later. We analyzed QoL changes over time and  looked for sex-specific and age-specific (<70 versus >70 years) differences.  RESULTS: A total of 126 cases were analyzed. The median age of the 73 male and 53  female patients was 59.2 years (range, 24.2 to 83.9). There was no significant  change between preoperative and postoperative QoL values for emotional,  cognitive, and social functioning. Significant deterioration of QoL items was  found for physical functioning (-11.0; p < 0.001), role functioning (-16.4; p <  0.001), fatigue (11.1; p < 0.001), pain (15.0; p < 0.001), and dyspnea (16.9; p <  0.001). There were no differences between sexes concerning preoperative and  postoperative scores. Younger patients (<70 years) had more preoperative symptoms  (1.9; p = 0.03) and a worse function (2.2; p = 0.04). A tendency was found for  decreased global QoL (-6.0; p = 0.08) in the older age group (>70 years) after  metastasectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary metastasectomy can be offered every  patient with a chance of cure or prolongation of life because the anticipated  midterm changes in QoL are of moderate clinical importance, and the change in  global health-related QoL is trivial.","['Welter, Stefan', 'Schwan, Alexandra', 'Cheufou, Danjouma', 'Darwiche, Kaid', 'Christoph, Daniel', 'Eberhardt, Wilfried', 'Weinreich, Gerhard', 'Stamatis, Georgios']",10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.11.059
"Epidermal growth factor receptor mutation study for 5 years, in a population of patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","INTRODUCTION: In 2006, the Vila Nova de Gaia/Espinho Hospital Centre Pulmonary Oncology Unit started performing EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) mutation  sequencing in selected patients with NSCLC and systematically in all patients  since 2010, regardless of histology, smoking habits, age or sex. The aim of this  study was to characterize the group of patients that carried out the sequencing  between 2006-2010, to determine EGFR mutation frequency, to evaluate the overall  survival and the survival after the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), in  patients who performed this therapy in second and third line, knowing the EGFR  mutation status. METHODS: Descriptive statistical analysis of patients who did  EGFR sequencing in 2006-2010 and of overall survival in patients treated with TKI  as 2nd and 3rd line therapy. Record of the material available for analysis and  average delay of exam results, according to the material submitted. RESULTS: The  sequencing was performed in 374 patients, 71,1% males, 67,1% non/ex-smokers,  32,9% smokers, 57,8% adenocarcinoma and 23,5% squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The  mutation was detected in 49 patients (13,1%). In all studied patients, the  mutation rate was 9% in males and 23% in females. Median overall survival after  erlotinib use of was 14 months for patients with positive EGFR mutation versus 6  months in not mutated patients (p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our group had an overall  mutation rate of 13.1% with female, non-smokers, adenocarcinoma histology  predominance. In selected patients (2006/2009), the mutation rate was 16%, in not  selected patients (2010) the mutation rate was 10.4%. This study has permitted a  better understanding of the EGFR mutation rate in the Portuguese population as  welll as an evaluation of the patients survival after the use of of tyrosine  kinase inhibitors, in second and third line therapy with previous knowledge of  the EGFR mutational status. Statistical significant differences in survival were  found in the two patient groups (EGFR mutated and non mutated). The EGFR mutation  research should be performed in all patients with NSCLC, giving the possibility  to a considerable number of patients to perform a first line treatment with TKI  (EGFR mutated patients) and the advantage of performing other chemotherapy  schemes, when progression occurs.","['Castro, A.

"Repressive coping style: relationships with depression, pain, and pain coping strategies in lung cancer outpatients.","Researchers have shown that coping style is related to pain and adjustment in people with chronic illness. This study was the first to examine how coping style  related to pain, pain coping strategies, and depression in lung cancer  outpatients. We conducted a comparative, secondary data analysis of 107 lung  cancer patients (73% male, mean age 61.4±10.43 years, 88% Caucasian). As in prior  studies, we classified patients into four coping style groups based on  Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale and trait anxiety scores. The coping  style groups were low-anxious (n=25); high-anxious (n=31); defensive high-anxious  (n=21); and repressive (n=30). Compared to other coping style groups, the  repressive group reported statistically significant lower mean scores for pain  quality, pain catastrophizing, and depression. Assessing coping style by  measuring personal characteristics such as social desirability and trait anxiety  may help clinicians to identify vulnerable individuals with lung cancer who may  be candidates for early and timely intervention efforts to enhance adjustment to  pain.","['Prasertsri, Nusara', 'Holden, Janean', 'Keefe, Francis J.', 'Wilkie, Diana J.']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2010.05.009
"Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2002, featuring population-based trends in cancer treatment.","BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American  Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to provide  information on cancer rates and trends in the United States. This year's report  updates statistics on the 15 most common cancers in the five major racial/ethnic  populations in the United States for 1992-2002 and features population-based  trends in cancer treatment. METHODS: The NCI, the CDC, and the NAACCR provided  information on cancer cases, and the CDC provided information on cancer deaths.  Reported incidence and death rates were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard  population, annual percent change in rates for fixed intervals was estimated by  linear regression, and annual percent change in trends was estimated with  joinpoint regression analysis. Population-based treatment data were derived from  the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registries,  SEER-Medicare linked databases, and NCI Patterns of Care/Quality of Care studies.  RESULTS: Among men, the incidence rates for all cancer sites combined were stable  from 1995 through 2002. Among women, the incidence rates increased by 0.3%  annually from 1987 through 2002. Death rates in men and women combined decreased  by 1.1% annually from 1993 through 2002 for all cancer sites combined and also  for many of the 15 most common cancers. Among women, lung cancer death rates  increased from 1995 through 2002, but lung cancer incidence rates stabilized from  1998 through 2002. Although results of cancer treatment studies suggest that much  of contemporary cancer treatment for selected cancers is consistent with  evidence-based guidelines, they also point to geographic, racial, economic, and  age-related disparities in cancer treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer death rates for  all cancer sites combined and for many common cancers have declined at the same  time as the dissemination of guideline-based treatment into the community has  increased, although this progress is not shared equally across all racial and  ethnic populations. Data from population-based cancer registries, supplemented by  linkage with administrative databases, are an important resource for monitoring  the quality of cancer treatment. Use of this cancer surveillance system, along  with new developments in medical informatics and electronic medical records, may  facilitate monitoring of the translation of basic science and clinical advances  to cancer prevention, detection, and uniformly high quality of care in all areas  and populations of the United States.","['Edwards, Brenda K.', 'Brown, Martin L.', 'Wingo, Phyllis A.', 'Howe, Holly L.', 'Ward, Elizabeth', 'Ries, Lynn A.

Multicentre randomised phase III study comparing the same dose and schedule of cisplatin plus the same schedule of vinorelbine or gemcitabine in advanced  non-small cell lung cancer.,"This study compares two cytotoxic regimens comprising the same dose and schedule of cisplatin (CP) plus vinorelbine (VNR) or gemcitabine (GEM) administered under  the same schedule to patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).  From April 1998 to February 2003, 285 patients were randomised to receive either  VNR 25 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 as an intravenous (i.v.) bolus plus CP 75 mg/m(2)  on day 1 (regimen A) or GEM 1200 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 as an i.v. 30-min  infusion plus CP 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 (regimen B). Both treatments were recycled  every 21 days. If no progression had occurred after six cycles, the patients  continued to receive VNR or GEM monochemotherapy weekly. Cross-over of the two  single agents was considered if disease progression occurred. Objective response  (OR), time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) were analysed according  to the intention-to-treat principle. 272 patients were ultimately eligible (137  on A and 135 on B). Their main characteristics were: male/female ratio 214/58;  median age 63 (range 32-77) years; median Karnofsky Performance Status (PS) 80  (range 70-100); stage IIIB 34%, stage IV 61%, recurrent disease 5%; histology -  epidermoid 29%, adenocarcinoma 53%, other NSCLC 18%. The characteristics of the  patients in the two arms were well matched. The following response rates were  observed in regimens A and B, respectively: complete response (CR) 0.7% and 3.7%,  partial response (PR) 31.9% and 22.2% (P = 0.321). Median CR+PR duration was 8  months in both arms. Clinical benefit represented by an improvement in symptoms  was evident in 25.7% and 28.1%, respectively. Median TTP was 5 months in both  arms and median OS 11 months in both arms. Grade III-IV neutropenia occurred in  30.7% and 17.7% of the patients in arms A and B, respectively (P = 0.017);  thrombocytopenia occurred in 0% and 9.3% (P = 0.004), respectively. No difference  in the incidence of anaemia was observed. Non-haematological toxicity was  generally mild: a higher incidence of grade 1-2 peripheral neurotoxicity and  grade 1-2 local toxicity with regimen A and grade 1-2 liver toxicity with regimen  B was reported. A pharmaco-economic comparison showed a difference between the  two doublets, principally due to the different costs of VNR and GEM. Under the  study conditions the combination of VNR or GEM with the same dose and schedule of  CP produced similar OR, clinical benefits, TTP and OS in advanced NSCLC, and only  mild toxicological differences were observed. Pharmaco-economic evaluation  favoured the CP + VNR doublet.","['Martoni, A.', 'Marino, A.', 'Sperandi, F.', 'Giaquinta, S.', 'Di Fabio, F.', 'Melotti, B.', 'Guaraldi, M.', 'Palomba, G.', 'Preti, P.', 'Petralia, A.', 'Artioli, F.', 'Picece, V.', 'Farris, A.', 'Mantovani, L.']",10.1016/j.ejca.2004.08.029
Short-term association between ambient air pollution and lung cancer mortality.,"RATIONALE: Long-term exposure to air pollution has been associated with increased lung cancer incidence and mortality. However, the short-term association between  air pollution and lung cancer mortality (LCM) remains largely unknown. METHODS:  We collected daily data on particulate matter with diameter <2.5 μm (PM(2.5)),  particulate matter with diameter < 10 μm (PM(10)), sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), and  ozone (O(3)), and LCM in three of the biggest cities in China, i.e. Beijing,  Chongqing, and Guangzhou, from 2013 to 2015. We first estimated city-specific  relationships between air pollutants and LCM using time-series generalized linear  models, adjusting for potential confounders. A classification and regression tree  (CART) model was used to stratify LCM risk based on combinations of air  pollutants and meteorological factors in each city. Then we pooled the  city-specific associations using random-effects meta-analysis. Meta regression  was used to explore if city-specific characteristics modified the air  pollution-LCM association. Finally, we stratified the analyses by season, age,  and sex. RESULTS: Over the entire period, the current-day concentrations of  PM(2.5) and PM(10) in Chongqing and PM(2.5), PM(10), and SO(2) in Guangzhou were  positively associated with LCM (Excess risk ranged from 0.72% (95% CI  0.27%-1.17%) to 6.06% (95% CI 0.76%-11.64%) with each 10 μg/m(3) increment in  different pollutants), but the association between current-day air pollution and  LCM in Beijing was not significant (P > 0.05). When considering the environmental  and weather factors simultaneously, current-day PM(2.5), relative humidity, and  PM(10) were the most important factors associated with LCM in Beijing, Chongqing,  and Guangzhou, respectively. LCM risk related with daily PM(2.5), PM(10), and  SO(2) significantly increased with the increasing annual mean temperature and  humidity of the city, while LCM risk related with daily O(3) significantly  increased with the increases of latitude, annual mean O(3) concentration, and  socioeconomic level. After stratification, the current-day PM(2.5), PM(10), and  O(3) during the warm season in Beijing and PM(2.5), PM(10), and SO(2) during the  cool season in Chongqing and Guangzhou were positively associated with LCM  (Excess risk ranged from 0.93% (95% CI 0.42%-1.45%) to 7.16% (95% CI  0.64%-14.09%) with each 10 μg/m(3) increment in different pollutants). Male and  the elderly lung cancer patients were more sensitive to the short-term effect of  air pollution. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer patients should enhance protection  measures against air pollution. More attentions should be paid for the high  PM(2.5), PM(10), and O(3) during the warm season in Beijing, and high PM(2.5),  PM(10), and SO(2) during the cool season in Chongqing and Guangzhou.","['Wang, Ning', 'Mengersen, Kerrie', 'Tong, Shilu', 'Kimlin, Michael', 'Zhou, Maigeng', 'Wang, Lijun', 'Yin, Peng', 'Xu, Zhiwei', 'Cheng, Jian', 'Zhang, Yuzhou', 'Hu, Wenbiao']",10.1016/j.envres.2019.108748
"The Burden of Trachea, Bronchus, and Lung Cancer Attributable to Occupational Exposure From 1990 to 2019.","OBJECTIVES: Occupational exposure to carcinogens is associated with trachea, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer. The objective of this study was to provide  global and regional estimates of the burden of TBL cancer associated with  occupational carcinogens (OCs) between 1990 and 2019. METHODS: Age-standardized  mortality rates (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years  (DALYs) rates (ASDR) of TBL cancer related to exposure to OCs at the global and  regional levels were extracted for 1990-2019 from the Global Burden of Disease  2019. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze trends in the ASMR and ASDR of TBL  cancer burden related to OCs, and the annual percent change and the average  annual percent change (AAPC) were recorded. RESULTS: The mortality from TBL  cancer related to exposure to OCs increased globally. The ASMR and ASDR decreased  in both sexes and in men between 1990 and 2019. The AAPC of ASMR and ASDR  decreased in men between 1990 and 2019, but increased in women. Asbestos  accounted for the highest death number and beryllium accounted for the lowest;  diesel engine exhaust caused the largest percentage change in death number  (145.3%), in ASDR (14.9%), and in all ages DALY rates (57.6%). Asbestos accounted  for the largest death number in high social development index (SDI) countries,  whereas low-middle SDI countries had the largest percent change (321.4%).  Asbestos was associated with decreased ASDR in high SDI countries and increased  ASDR in low-middle SDI countries, and similar changes were observed for other  OCs. CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality and DALYs of TBL cancer burden related to  OCs showed a decreasing trend between 1990 and 2019, whereas death number  increased. Asbestos accounted for the highest death number. TBL cancer burden  related to OCs decreased to different degrees in high, low, low-middle, and  middle SDI countries, which showed variable levels of TBL cancer burden related  to exposure to OCs (except asbestos).","['Li, Haifeng', 'Guo, Jingwen', 'Liang, Hongsen', 'Zhang, Ting', 'Zhang, Jinyu', 'Wei, Li', 'Shi, Donglei', 'Zhang, Junhang', 'Wang, Zhaojun']",10.3389/fpubh.2022.928937
Impact of the multidisciplinary education program in self-care on fatigue in lung cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer has high mortality rates, with up to 90% of patients dying within one to two years of its onset. It is essential to carry out research  to attempt to solve the problems. Most patients suffer serious fatigue resulting  from various symptoms and its long-term treatment. Furthermore, the other related  complications such as underlying disease, anemia, malnutrition, nausea, and  vomiting can reduced tolerance of chemotherapy. Study showed that nurses are the  only hospital staff involved in managing fatigue. As it remains unclear to how  fatigue should be managed, it is important to devise a strategy for providing a  better service to help these patients survive longer. OBJECTIVE: To examine  fatigue scores in patients with lung cancer after chemotherapy treatment, and to  compare the scores of the group receiving the multidisciplinary education program  in self-care group with those of the control group. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A  randomized controlled trial was conducted in two groups. The control group and  the trial group were 30 patients in each. Studied aged from 45 to 65 years old  who were receiving chemotherapy at the Chemotherapy Unit in the Out-Patients  Department, Rajavithi Hospital. For a nine-week period, the control group  received the hospital's normal care program while the trial group received the  multidisciplinary education program in self-care on fatigue. Scores were  allocated to each individual to reflect their levels of fatigue, nutrition,  physical fitness, and depression, compared using Independent t-test, Fisher exact  test, and Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled into the  study (mean age = 56.10 (45-65), male = 68.33%). The basic characteristics of  each individual were not significantly different between the two groups. The mean  (+/- SD) fatigue scores were 2.98 +/- 1.96 and 3.99 +/- 1.64 for the control and  the trial group respectively, and these figures were statistically significant (p  = 0.036). Nutrition scores were significantly higher in the trial group than in  the control group (p = 0.002), but the other scores weight, albumin, physical  fitness, and depression were not significantly different between the two groups.  CONCLUSION: The multidisciplinary education program in self-care results in  decreased fatigue in patients with lung cancer who are receiving chemotherapy.  Therefore, it is recommended that more health professionals and specialists  participate actively inpatient care to respond directly to patients' needs. This  strategy should be adopted as the standard guideline for caring for patients with  cancer who are receiving chemotherapy, and for patients with other conditions.","['Wangnum, Kotchukorn', 'Thanarojanawanich, Thanyaluck', 'Chinwatanachai, Kwanta', 'Jamprasert, Lawan', 'Maleehuan, Onarmon', 'Janthakun, Vachira']",
Efficacy and safety of percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation in the treatment of lung cancer lesions.,"INTRODUCTION: In this study, we reviewed a clinical series composed by all malignant lung lesions submitted to computed tomography-guided percutaneous  thermal radiofrequency ablation, in our hospital, a rather recent technique that  has been gaining scientific recognition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For data purposes,  all radiofrequency ablation and corresponding clinical records were  retrospectively analysed. A computed tomography scan was performed before and  after each procedure to evaluate the tumour's features, and at a second step to  assess results and complications. The frequency of local recurrence and disease  progression were determined based on imaging follow-up. Kaplan-Meier analysis was  used to estimate survival. Univariate analysis recognized clinical and  pathological factors affecting survival. These were also tested by multivariate  analysis. RESULTS: A total of 28 malignant lung lesions, 20 primary and 8  metastatic, from 28 patients (78.6% male; mean age 62 ± 17 years old), were  submitted to computed tomography-guided radiofrequency ablation between January  2004 and July 2010. Total necrosis was achieved in 74.1% of the lesions.  Immediate radiofrequency ablation-related complications were observed in half of  the procedures. Among major complications, death occurred in one patient only.  Median overall survival was 43.0 months for a mean 2-years follow-up.Median  progression-free survival was 31.6 months. Lesion's size smaller than 35 mm,  stage III disease by the TNM classification and previous treatment attempts were  significantly associated with better outcomes. Disease-related mortality was  46.4%. DISCUSSION: This procedure proved to be efficient to treat lung cancerous  lesions, with a low-rate of major complications.

Efficacy and Safety of Pembrolizumab Plus Docetaxel vs Docetaxel Alone in Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: The PROLUNG  Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.,"IMPORTANCE: Because of socioeconomic factors, many patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) do not receive immunotherapy in the first-line  setting. It is unknown if the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy can  provide clinical benefits in immunotherapy-naive patients with disease  progression after treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To  evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of pembrolizumab plus  docetaxel in patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC following  platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of EGFR variants or programmed cell death  ligand 1 status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Pembrolizumab Plus  Docetaxel for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (PROLUNG) trial randomized 78  patients with histologically confirmed advanced NSCLC in a 1:1 ratio to receive  either pembrolizumab plus docetaxel or docetaxel alone from December 2016 through  May 2019. INTERVENTIONS: The experimental arm received docetaxel on day 1 (75  mg/m2) plus pembrolizumab on day 8 (200 mg) every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles  followed by pembrolizumab maintenance until progression or unacceptable toxic  effects. The control arm received docetaxel monotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND  MEASURES: The primary end point was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary end  points included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, and safety.  RESULTS: Among 78 recruited patients, 32 (41%) were men, 34 (44%) were never  smokers, and 25 (32%) had an EGFR/ALK alteration. Forty patients were allocated  to receive pembrolizumab plus docetaxel, and 38 were allocated to receive  docetaxel. A statistically significant difference in ORR, assessed by an  independent reviewer, was found in patients receiving pembrolizumab plus  docetaxel vs patients receiving docetaxel (42.5% vs 15.8%; odds ratio, 3.94; 95%  CI, 1.34-11.54; P = .01). Patients without EGFR variations had a considerable  difference in ORR of 35.7% vs 12.0% (P = .06), whereas patients with EGFR  variations had an ORR of 58.3% vs 23.1% (P = .14). Overall, PFS was longer in  patients who received pembrolizumab plus docetaxel (9.5 months; 95% CI, 4.2-not  reached) than in patients who received docetaxel (3.9 months; 95% CI, 3.2-5.7)  (hazard ratio, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13-0.46; P < .001). For patients without  variations, PFS was 9.5 months (95% CI, 3.9-not reached) vs 4.1 months (95% CI,  3.5-5.3) (P < .001), whereas in patients with EGFR variations, PFS was 6.8 months  (95% CI, 6.2-not reached) vs 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.3-6.2) (P = .04). In terms of  safety, 23% (9 of 40) vs 5% (2 of 38) of patients experienced grade 1 to 2  pneumonitis in the pembrolizumab plus docetaxel and docetaxel arms, respectively  (P = .03), while 28% (11 of 40) vs 3% (1 of 38) experienced any-grade  hypothyroidism (P = .002). No new safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: In this phase 2 study, the combination of pembrolizumab plus docetaxel  was well tolerated and substantially improved ORR and PFS in patients with  advanced NSCLC who had previous progression after platinum-based chemotherapy,  including NSCLC with EGFR variations.

A novel approach to analyzing lung cancer mortality disparities: Using the exposome and a graph-theoretical toolchain.,"OBJECTIVES: The aim is to identify exposures associated with lung cancer mortality and mortality disparities by race and gender using an exposome database  coupled to a graph theoretical toolchain. METHODS: Graph theoretical algorithms  were employed to extract paracliques from correlation graphs using associations  between 2162 environmental exposures and lung cancer mortality rates in 2067  counties, with clique doubling applied to compute an absolute threshold of  significance. Factor analysis and multiple linear regressions then were used to  analyze differences in exposures associated with lung cancer mortality and  mortality disparities by race and gender. RESULTS: While cigarette consumption  was highly correlated with rates of lung cancer mortality for both white men and  women, previously unidentified novel exposures were more closely associated with  lung cancer mortality and mortality disparities for blacks, particularly black  women. CONCLUSIONS: Exposures beyond smoking moderate lung cancer mortality and  mortality disparities by race and gender. POLICY IMPLICATIONS: An exposome  approach and database coupled with scalable combinatorial analytics provides a  powerful new approach for analyzing relationships between multiple environmental  exposures, pathways and health outcomes. An assessment of multiple exposures is  needed to appropriately translate research findings into environmental public  health practice and policy.","['Juarez, Paul D.', 'Hood, Darryl B.', 'Rogers, Gary L.', 'Baktash, Suzanne H.', 'Saxton, Arnold M.', 'Matthews-Juarez, Patricia', 'Im, Wansoo', 'Cifuentes, Myriam Patricia', 'Phillips, Charles A.', 'Lichtveld, Maureen Y.', 'Langston, Michael A.']",
Trends in cancer mortality in Spain: the influence of the financial crisis.,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if the onset of the economic crisis in Spain affected cancer mortality and mortality trends. METHOD: We conducted a longitudinal  ecological study based on all cancer-related deaths and on specific types of  cancer (lung, colon, breast and prostate) in Spain between 2000 and 2013. We  computed age-standardised mortality rates in men and women, and fit mixed Poisson  models to analyse the effect of the crisis on cancer mortality and trends  therein. RESULTS: After the onset of the economic crisis, cancer mortality  continued to decline, but with a significant slowing of the yearly rate of  decline (men: RR = 0.987, 95%CI = 0.985-0.990, before the crisis, and RR = 0.993,  95%CI = 0.991-0.996, afterwards; women: RR = 0.990, 95%CI = 0.988-0.993, before,  and RR = 1.002, 95%CI = 0.998-1.006, afterwards). In men, lung cancer mortality  was reduced, continuing the trend observed in the pre-crisis period; the trend in  colon cancer mortality did not change significantly and continued to increase;  and the yearly decline in prostate cancer mortality slowed significantly. In  women, lung cancer mortality continued to increase each year, as before the  crisis; colon cancer continued to decease; and the previous yearly downward trend  in breast cancer mortality slowed down following the onset of the crisis.  CONCLUSIONS: Since the onset of the economic crisis in Spain the rate of decline  in cancer mortality has slowed significantly, and this situation could be  exacerbated by the current austerity measures in healthcare.","['Ferrando, Josep', 'Palència, Laia', 'Gotsens, Mercè', 'Puig-Barrachina, Vanessa', ""Marí-Dell'Olmo, Marc"", 'Rodríguez-Sanz, Maica', 'Bartoll, Xavier', 'Borrell, Carme']",10.1016/j.gaceta.2017.11.008
Racial and ethnic disparities in smoking prevalence in Israel and the United States: progress to date and prospects for the future.,"An article in this journal in 2016 demonstrated that smoking prevalence among Arab men in Israel is greater than among their Jewish counterparts born in  Israel, while the reverse is true among Arab and Jewish Israeli women. This is  reflected in lung cancer mortality rates. In the U.S., smoking prevalence in the  mid-1960s was 20% higher in African American men than in white men, but has since  decreased in both groups, and smoking prevalence in the two groups is now nearly  identical. The black-white disparity in lung cancer mortality rates has been  reduced by more than half as compared to its zenith in the early 1990s. The  strategies employed to achieve these gains will continue to be important going  forward, and successful strategies employed in Israel in addressing smoking in  the male Arab population will be of increasing interest in the U.S. as its Arab  population increases.","['Blumenthal, Daniel S.']",10.1186/s13584-017-0177-9
Analysis of cancer incidence and mortality in the industrial region of South-East Siberia from 1991 through 2010.,"Kemerovo is an industrial region of the Russian Federation characterized by highly developed mining, chemical, metallurgical and power industries. Many of  the factories were closed down due to the socioeconomical crisis in the early  90's, and economic potential of the survivors has also decreased significantly.  Paradoxically, this has led to the improvement of the ecological situation in the  region and elimination of exposure to many chemical carcinogens. This factor, in  combination with the improvement of oncological care, might be expected to have  lead to a decline of cancer incidence and mortality in the region. To assess  trends of cancer incidence and mortality in Kemerovo Region, we therefore carried  out an analysis of relevant epidemiological data during 1991-2010. In fact, a  significant increase of cancer incidence overall was revealed during 2001-2010.  Male cancer incidence was significantly higher than female cancer incidence.  Regarding gastric cancer incidence, statistically significant differences during  2001-2010 were found only for men, and male incidence exceeded female incidence.  Concerning colorectal cancer incidence, it was lower during 2001-2005 and  2006-2010 as compared to the period of 1991-1996. Lung cancer incidence was  significantly higher during 1991-2000 compared to 2001-2010. Among urban  populations, cancer incidence was higher in comparison with rural population, but  a gradual steady convergence of trends of cancer incidence among urban and rural  populations was noted. Lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer,  non-melanoma skin cancer, and gastric cancer are the most prevalent cancer forms  in Kemerovo Region. There were no differences in cancer mortality between  2001-2005 and 2006-2010; however, male cancer mortality exceeded female cancer  mortality. A similar situation was observed for gastric cancer, colorectal  cancer, and lung cancer. Cancer mortality among urban populations exceeded  mortality among rural population, for both genders. We suggest that these data  can be used for development of modern programs of cancer prevention and early  diagnostics in industrial regions of Siberia.","['Kutikhin, Anton G.', 'Yuzhalin, Arseniy E.', 'Brailovskiy, Valeriy V.', 'Zhivotovskiy, Alexey S.', 'Magarill, Yuri A.', 'Brusina, Elena B.']",10.7314/apjcp.2012.13.10.5189
Combined Biomarker and Computed Tomography Screening Strategies for Lung Cancer: Projections of Health and Economic Tradeoffs in the US Population.,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening with computed tomography (CT) of individuals who meet certain age and smoking history criteria is the current  standard-of-care. METHODS: Using a published simulation model, we compared  outcomes associated with seven biomarker+CT screening strategies to CT screening  alone using CMS eligibility criteria. We assumed that the biomarker: had  conditionally independent performance; was used for first-line screening in some,  or all, individuals screened; and could be extended to CMS-ineligible smokers.  Strategies differed by inclusion criteria (e.g. pack-years) and proportion of  individuals for whom CT remained the first-line test. Each model run simulated a  combined cohort of one million men and one million women born in 1950. Primary  outcomes were cancer-specific mortality reduction and screening costs; biomarker  costs were measured relative to CT. Efficiency frontiers identified optimal  health and economic trade-offs. Sensitivity analysis evaluated the stability of  results. RESULTS: Standard-of-care screening yielded an 8.3% cancer-specific  mortality reduction in the simulated U.S. population (screened+unscreened  individuals). For a biomarker test with 75% sensitivity and 95% specificity,  mortality reductions across biomarker+CT strategies ranged from 7.0% to 23.9%. If  the biomarker's cost was >0.86× that of CT, standard-of-care screening remained  on the efficiency frontier, indicating that health and economic trade-offs were  equally (or more) efficient relative to all biomarker+CT strategies. Biomarker+CT  strategy costs were principally driven by biomarker specificity; mortality  reduction was driven by sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Combined biomarker+CT strategies  have the potential to improve future lung cancer screening effectiveness in the  U.S. and achieve economic efficiency that is greater than the current  standard-of-care.","['Kong, Chung Yin', 'Sheehan, Deirdre F.', 'McMahon, Pamela M.', 'Gazelle, G.

Estimation of Lead Time via Low-Dose CT in the National Lung Screening Trial.,"Based on recent reports from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), smokers who were screened by low-dose computer tomography (LDCT) had a 20% lower chance  of dying from lung cancer than those screened by chest X-rays. However, due to  the complexities of lead time bias and over diagnosis, no formal test has been  shown to reduce lung cancer mortality. To correctly evaluate survival benefit due  to early detection, it is critical to estimate lead time, the length of time that  detection of a disease is advanced by screening. We applied a recently developed  probability method to estimate lead time, using the LDCT data from NLST, where  human lifetime was treated as random and derived from the actuarial life table of  the US Social Security Administration. Using Bayesian posterior samples of key  parameters extracted from the NLST-LDCT data, simulations on lead time were  carried out on 16 hypothetical cohorts with four initial ages (55, 60, 65, and  70) and four future screening intervals (12, 18, 24, and 30 months). For each  scenario, the estimated lead time for both screen-detected and interval cases is  reported. Results show that the probability of no-early-detection (interval  cases) increases monotonically when the screening interval increases for both  genders. A male heavy smoker with an initial screening age at 60 has 11.65%  (female 6.76%) chance of no-early-detection with annual screenings. This  probability increases to 36.35% (female 28.26%) if the screenings were biennial.  The mean lead time appears longer for women than for men. The mean lead time  decreases when the screening interval increases, but it appears stable across  different initial age groups. These results lay a foundation to evaluate survival  benefit accurately with LDCT and to schedule future screening exams.","['Liu, Ruiqi', 'Pérez, Adriana', 'Wu, Dongfeng']",10.1007/s41666-018-0027-8
"Smoking, depression, and hospital costs of respiratory cancers: Examining race and sex variation.","OBJECTIVE: The role of smoking and depression relative to hospital cost for lung cancer (LC) remains unknown. METHODS: We extracted data on depression, smoking  history, demographics, and hospital charges on patients with respiratory cancers  (ICD-9 codes 161-163,165) from the 2008 Tennessee Hospital Discharge Data System.  The sample (n=6,665) was mostly white (86%) and male (57). Age-adjusted rates  were developed per CDC methodology, and hospital costs were compared for LC with  vs. without depression and smoking. RESULTS: Three findings (p<.001) emerged: (i)  LC rate was higher among blacks than whites, and higher among males than females;  (ii) While 66% of LC smoked (more males than females without racial variation),  24% had depression (more females and whites were depressed); (iii) The LC  hospital cost was 54% higher compared to non-LC, and this cost doubled for LC  with depression and smoking vs. those without such characteristics. CONCLUSION:  While LC is more prevalent among blacks and males, depression is higher among  female and white patients. Since depression with higher costs existed among LC  patients, our findings point to: (i) possibility of cost savings by diagnosing  and treating depression among LC, and (ii) implementing proven smoking cessation  programs to reduce LC morbidity and hospital costs.","['Husaini, Baqar', 'Levine, Robert', 'Lammers, Phillip', 'Hull, Pam', 'Novotny, Meggan', 'Moonis, Majaz']",10.15212/FMCH.2017.0109
Lung cancer in Brazil.,"Cancer is now the second leading cause of death in Brazil (after cardiovascular diseases) and a public health problem, with around 500,000 new cases in 2012.  Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer, lung cancer is the second most incident cancer  type in men, with 17,210 expected new cases. In women, it is the fifth most  incident cancer, with 10,110 expected new cases. The estimated age-adjusted lung  cancer mortality rate is about 13/100,000 for men and 5.4/100,000 for women. Lung  cancer rates in men increased until the early 1990s and decreased thereafter,  especially in the younger population. In contrast, a steady upward trend was  observed for women. The positive effects in men were probably due to the  successful anti-tobacco campaign conducted in Brazil over the last decades, which  led to a decrease in the adult smoking population, from 32% in the early 1980s to  17% in the 2000s. Although the Brazilian National Cancer Institute is strongly  committed to providing excellence in multimodality care to cancer patients,  limitations in availability and adequate geographic distribution of specialists  and well-equipped cancer centers are evident. Major disparities in patient access  to proper staging and state-of-the-art treatment still exist. Considering that  World Health Organization (WHO) officials estimate that cancer will become the  number one cause of death in most developing countries, including Brazil, in the  next decades, it is highly recommended for government authorities to implement  firm actions to face this tremendous challenge.","['Schwartsmann, Gilberto']",10.14694/EdBook_AM.2012.32.185
Evaluation of the Benefits and Harms of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: A Collaborative Modeling Study for the U.S. Preventive  Services Task Force,"IMPORTANCE: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is updating its 2013 lung cancer screening recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To inform the USPSTF by  evaluating the benefits and harms of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT)  screening strategies by conducting simulation modeling; comparing strategies with  varying starting and stopping ages, screening frequency, and eligibility criteria  (based on smoking pack-years and years since quitting smoking or based on  individual lung cancer risk); and identifying efficient strategies that provide  the best balance of benefits (lung cancer deaths prevented and life-years gained  [LYG]) and harms for a given level of LDCT screens. DESIGN, SETTING, AND  PARTICIPANTS: Collaborative modeling with four lung cancer natural history models  for individuals from the 1950 and 1960 birth cohorts from ages 45 to 90 years  with no prior lung cancer diagnosis. EXPOSURES: Screening with LDCT with varying  starting ages (45, 50, 55 years), stopping ages (75, 77, 80 years), and screening  frequency (annual, biennial). Eligibility criteria based on either age,  cumulative pack-years (20, 25, 30, 40 years) and years since quitting smoking  (10, 15, 20, 25 years) (risk factor–based strategies) or age and individual lung  cancer risk estimation using three established risk prediction models (Bach, Lung  Cancer Death Risk Assessment Tool, and PLCOm2012) with varying risk thresholds  for eligibility (risk model–based strategies). A total of 1,093 (289 risk  factor–based and 804 risk model–based) strategies were evaluated. Full uptake and  adherence for all scenarios were assumed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Benefits:  Lung cancer deaths averted and LYG compared with no screening per 100,000  population. Harms: Lifetime number of LDCT screens, false-positive results,  biopsies, overdiagnosed cases, and radiation-related lung cancer deaths per  100,000 population. RESULTS: We identified a set of LDCT screening programs that  are efficient and result in the most lung cancer deaths averted and LYG for a  given level of screening (number of LDCT screens). Most efficient risk  factor–based strategies start screening at age 50 or 55 years and stop screening  at the age of 80 years. Most efficient risk factor–based strategies with at least  9 percent lung cancer mortality reduction have 20 pack-years as the minimum  criterion for eligibility. The 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria, which was  selected based on lung cancer deaths averted using the 1950 birth cohort, is not  among the efficient strategies for the 1960 birth cohort when considering both  lung cancer deaths averted and LYG. However, annual strategies with the 20  pack-years minimum criterion, starting age of 50 or 55 years and stopping age of  80 years are efficient and result in increased screening eligibility (20.6% to  23.6% eligible) and considerably more lung cancer deaths averted (469 to 558 per  100,000) and LYG (6,018 to 7,596 per 100,000) than the 2013 USPSTF-recommended  strategy (14.1% eligible, 381 lung cancer deaths averted and 4,882 LYG per  100,000). However these strategies also result in more false-positive tests (1.9  to 2.5 vs. 1.9 per person screened), overdiagnosed cases (83 to 94 vs. 69 per  100,000), and radiation-related lung cancer deaths (29.0 to 42.5 vs. 20.6 per  100,000) than the 2013 USPSTF-recommended strategy. The 20 pack-year strategies  result in higher relative increases vs. the 2013 USPSTF-recommended criteria in  eligibility, lung cancer deaths prevented, and LYG for women than men. These  strategies also result in higher relative increases compared with the 2013  USPSTF-recommended criteria in eligibility for non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics,  and American Indian/Alaska Natives than for non-Hispanic whites and Asians. Among  risk model–based screening strategies, the net benefits and harms of screening  strongly depend on the risk model’s specific risk thresholds. Risk model–based  vs. risk factor–based strategies result in higher numbers of lung cancer deaths  prevented and modest additional LYGs and induce fewer radiation-related lung  cancer deaths; however, they result in more overdiagnosed cases. The general  patterns observed for the 1960 birth cohort for men and women combined hold for  each sex and for the 1950 birth cohort. LIMITATIONS: Simulations assumed 100  percent screening uptake and adherence. Relative performance of compared  strategies might change if uptake and adherence differ by age or screening  frequency. The models extrapolated results from short-term randomized trials with  three LDCT annual screens to lifetime screening and followup. Simulations did not  consider incidental findings and were restricted to the 1950 and 1960 U.S. birth  cohorts. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This collaborative modeling analysis suggests  that LDCT screening could lead to important reductions of lung cancer mortality  and result in significant LYG when optimally targeted. In particular, screening  individuals ages 50 or 55 years through 80 years with 20 or more pack-years of  smoking exposure would result in more benefits than current criteria and would  reduce disparities in eligibility by sex and race/ethnicity. Risk model–based  screening strategies could result in higher benefits compared with risk  factor–based screening strategies; however, the analysis did not consider issues  of implementation and other potential challenges of risk model–based screening  strategies.","['Meza, Rafael', 'Jeon, Jihyoun', 'Toumazis, Iakovos', 'ten Haaf, Kevin', 'Cao, Pianpian', 'Bastani, Mehrad', 'Han, Summer S.', 'Blom, Erik F.', 'Jonas, Daniel', 'Feuer, Eric J.', 'Plevritis, Sylvia K.', 'de Koning, Harry J.', 'Kong, Chung Yin']",
On the sex ratio of all-cause and disease-specific mortality rates worldwide.,"The sex ratio of mortality has important social implications but is only rarely considered. Women have lower mortality rates than men. The sex ratio of mortality  is cause-specific and differs markedly between populations. Assuming that the  genetic differences between the sexes are very similar between populations  implies that the differences in the sex ratio cannot be explained by genetic  factors. Gender differences in smoking levels exert a strong influence on the sex  ratio of lung cancer, total cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. The sex ratio  of mortality decreases with age. The mortality rates between the genders are  highly significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) both at younger and older age  classes, except for lung cancer in the 45-74 y age class. This demonstrates that  identical factors influence the mortality rates of both genders, but at a lower  level in women.","['Kesteloot, H.']",
Cognitive behavioral symptom management intervention in patients with cancer: survival analysis.,"PURPOSE: Associations between psychological factors and cancer survival have been under debate. We retrospectively explored the effect of the Cancer Care  Intervention (CCI), an individually delivered cognitive behavioral symptom  management intervention on survival in individuals with cancer. METHODS: Data  were obtained from a randomized controlled trial (R01 CA79280; 1997-2003) that  were originally designed to evaluate the CCI to reduce symptom severity in 237  individuals with solid tumors during their first course of chemotherapy.  Participants were randomized into: (1) ten-contact, 20-week CCI plus usual care  (n = 118) and (2) usual care only (n = 119). Survival data as of June 2009 were  censored based upon Social Security Death Index. RESULTS: Participants were  mostly female (73.4%), Caucasian (92.8%), and 59.6 ± 10.5 years old. Breast  (38.8%) and lung (35%) cancer were the most common cancer types. At enrollment,  66.7% of the participants had cancers at stage III or greater. Overall mortality  was 53.2% (126 of 237). The CCI did not significantly affect survival (median  survival, CCI = 88 months; usual care = 53.3 months; log rank = 0.30, p = 0.58).  Age, stage of cancer, and surgical removal of the tumor were the only factors  significantly associated with survival. Post hoc analysis stratified by cancer  site and gender (women with breast cancer, women with lung cancer, men with lung  cancer, and others) showed no survival effect from the CCI. CONCLUSION: In this  analysis, the CCI was not associated with better survival. For future research,  studies exploring survival outcomes need to consider specific characteristics of  each intervention and cancer type.","['Choi, JiYeon', 'Kuo, Chien-Wen J.', 'Sikorskii, Alla', 'You, Mei', 'Ren, Dianxu', 'Sherwood, Paula R.', 'Given, Charles W.', 'Given, Barbara A.']",10.1007/s00520-011-1210-0
"Gender Differences in Coping, Depression, and Anxiety in Patients with Non-Metastatic Lung Cancer.","BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent issues amongst individuals suffering from thoracic cancer. Gender differences in coping with thoracic cancer  have a serious impact upon the management of emotional distress. The purpose of  our study has been to assess sex variations in handling anxiety and depression,  including the use of coping mechanisms and their relationship with respect to  anxiety and depression. METHODS: This cross-sectional study registered 18 women  and 22 men with non-metastatic lung cancer and operated upon. Pre-operatively and  at one month post-operatively, the patients were assessed by means of scales  (COPE, GAD-7 and PHQ-9). RESULTS: Post-operatively, the intensity of depression  and anxiety was substantially greater in males than in females (p = 0.049, p =  0.042). Male individuals tended to use coping mechanisms of humour (p = 0.009)  and restraint (p = 0.029) significantly more frequently than women. Moreover, in  women, depression correlated significantly with denial and behavioural  deactivation (rho = 0.465, p = 0.029, respectively, rho = 0.562, p = 0.006);  whilst anxiety, similarly, correlated with positive interpretation, behavioural  deactivation, and use of social-emotional support (rho = 0.484, p = 0.022,  respectively, rho = 0.590, p = 0.004 and rho = 0.502, p = 0.017). Furthermore, in  males, depression correlated significantly with mental deactivation, use of  social-instrumental and social-emotional support (rho = 0.702, p = 0.001,  respectively, rho = 0.505, p=0.033, and rho = 0.773 with p < 0.001), whilst  anxiety correlated significantly with mental deactivation, denial, and use of  social-emotional support (rho = 0.597, p = 0.009, respectively, rho = 0.553 with  p = 0.017 and rho = 0.755, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: There were gender divergences  in the use of coping mechanisms and the level of post-surgical anxiety and  depression. We found significant positive relationships between some coping  mechanisms and depression/anxiety. The patient's gender governs the coping style,  which in turn has bearing upon the post-operative evolution.","['Hasan, Elisei Moise', 'Calma, Crenguta Livia', 'Tudor, Anca', 'Vernic, Corina', 'Palade, Emanuel', 'Tudorache, Emanuela', 'Oancea, Cristian', 'Papava, Ion']",10.2147/CMAR.S368992
Timely Curative Treatment and Overall Mortality Among Veterans With Stage I NSCLC.,"INTRODUCTION: Early stage lung cancer (LC) outcomes depend on the receipt of timely therapy. We aimed to determine the proportions of Veterans with stage I  NSCLC in the age group eligible for LC screening (LCS) receiving timely curative  treatment (≤12 wk after diagnosis), the factors associated with timely treatment  and modality, and the factors associated with overall mortality. METHODS:  Retrospective cohort study in Veterans aged 55 to 80 years when diagnosed with  stage I NSCLC during 2011 to 2015. We used multivariate logistic regression  models to determine factors associated with receiving timely therapy and  receiving surgery versus stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). We used  multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to determine factors  associated with overall mortality. RESULTS: We identified 4796 Veterans with  stage I NSCLC; the cohort was predominantly older, White males, current or former  smokers, and living in urban areas. Overall, 84% underwent surgery and 16%  underwent SBRT. The median time to treatment was 63 days (61 d for surgery; 71 d  for SBRT), with 30% treated more than 12 weeks. Unmarried Veterans with higher  social deprivation index were less likely to receive timely therapy. Black race,  female sex, and never smoking were associated with lower overall mortality. Older  Veterans receiving treatment >12 wk, with higher comorbidity index, and squamous  cell carcinoma had higher overall mortality. CONCLUSIONS: A total of 30% of the  Veterans with stage I NSCLC in the age group eligible for LCS received curative  treatment more than 12 weeks after diagnosis, which was associated with higher  overall mortality. Delays in LC treatment could decrease the mortality benefits  of LCS among the Veterans.","['Sanchez, Rolando', 'Vaughan Sarrazin, Mary S.', 'Hoffman, Richard M.']",10.1016/j.jtocrr.2022.100455
Global trends of lung cancer mortality and smoking prevalence.,"Lung cancer killed approximately 1,590,000 persons in 2012 and currently is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. There is large variation in mortality  rates across the world in both males and females. This variation follows trend of  smoking, as tobacco smoking is responsible for the majority of lung cancer cases.  In this article, we present estimated worldwide lung cancer mortality rates in  2012 using the World Health Organization (WHO) GLOBOCAN 2012 and changes in the  rates during recent decades in select countries using WHO Mortality Database. We  also show smoking prevalence and trends globally and at the regional level. By  region, the highest lung cancer mortality rates (per 100,000) in 2012 were in  Central and Eastern Europe (47.6) and Eastern Asia (44.8) among males and in  Northern America (23.5) and Northern Europe (19.1) among females; the lowest  rates were in sub-Saharan Africa in both males (4.4) and females (2.2). The  highest smoking prevalence among males is generally in Eastern and South-Eastern  Asia and Eastern Europe, and among females is in European countries, followed by  Oceania and Northern and Southern America. Many countries, notably high-income  countries, have seen a considerable decrease in smoking prevalence in both males  and females, but in many other countries there has been little decrease or even  an increase in smoking prevalence. Consequently, depending on whether or when  smoking prevalence has started to decline, the lung cancer mortality trend is a  mixture of decreasing, stable, or increasing. Despite major achievements in  tobacco control, with current smoking patterns lung cancer will remain a major  cause of death worldwide for several decades. The main priority to reduce the  burden of lung cancer is to implement or enforce effective tobacco control  policies in order to reduce smoking prevalence in all countries and prevent an  increase in smoking in sub-Saharan Africa and women in low- and middle-income  countries (LMICs).","['Islami, Farhad', 'Torre, Lindsey A.', 'Jemal, Ahmedin']",10.3978/j.issn.2218-6751.2015.08.04
Quality of life of elderly persons with newly diagnosed cancer.,"The aim was to investigate quality of life (QoL) in elderly persons newly diagnosed with cancer (65+ years) in relation to age, contact with the  health-care system, ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL), hope,  social network and support, and to identify which factors were associated with  low QoL. The sample consisted of 101 patients (75 women and 26 men) newly  diagnosed with cancer. EORTC QLQ-C30, Nowotny's Hope Scale, Katz ADL and the  Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (ISSI) were used. The analysis was  carried out in four age groups and revealed no significant differences in QoL.  Compared with the other age groups, those of a high age (80+ years) more often  lived alone, used more home-help service and had a smaller social network.  Factors associated with low QoL were 'no other incomes than retirement pension',  'low level of hope' and 'lung cancer'. In addition, 'being told that the cancer  disease has not come to an end', 'needing more help in activities of daily  living', 'getting help from grown-up children' and 'needing help with PADL' were  associated with low QoL. Those at risk of inferior QoL, that is, having poor  economy, low level of hope and lung cancer need special attendance and specific  interventions to improve QoL.","['Esbensen, B.

Differential eligibility of African American and European American lung cancer cases using LDCT screening guidelines.,"INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer incidence and mortality is higher among African Americans compared with European Americans in the USA where screening guidelines  are currently in place and based on age at diagnosis and smoking history. Given  the different smoking patterns observed in these populations and the earlier age  at which African Americans are diagnosed, it is possible that African Americans  will be disproportionally excluded from screening programmes. METHODS: We  assessed the capture of African American and EA lung cancer cases using the  National Lung Screening Trial, US Preventive Services Task Force and Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services eligibility guidelines in a population of lung  cancer cases diagnosed between 1998 and 2014 in the Baltimore region of Maryland  (n=1658). RESULTS: We found an absolute increase of 3.8% (relative increase:  11.5%) of EA lung cancer cases that fell within the eligible screening guidelines  when compared with African Americans. This difference in proportions was not  statistically significant (p=0.134). However, differences were more pronounced  among women, where an absolute and relative difference of 4.2% and 13.6%,  respectively, was observed (p=0.083). As more EA are likely to successfully quit  smoking compared with African Americans, the inclusion of the time since quitting  variable decreased the relative differences in eligibility. CONCLUSIONS: Current  screening guidelines are projected to capture a higher proportion of EA lung  cancer cases than African American cases; however, the differences are not  statistically significant. Further studies are needed, especially among high-risk  populations, to determine if racial differences in eligibility criteria for lung  screening will lead to a widening of cancer health disparities.","['Ryan, Bríd M.']",10.1136/bmjresp-2016-000166
Cancer mortality in central Serbia.,"PURPOSE: Cancer is the one of the leading cause of death worldwide. The aim of this study was to examine cancer mortality trends in the population of central  Serbia in the period from 2002 to 2011. METHODS: The descriptive epidemiological  method was used. The mortality from all malignant tumors (code C00-C96 of the  International Disease Classification) was registered. The source of mortality  data was the published material of the Cancer Registry of Serbia. The source of  population data was the census of 2002 and 2011 and the estimates for  inter-census years. Non-standardized, age-adjusted and age-specific mortality  rates were calculated. Age adjustment of mortality rates was performed by the  direct method of standardization. Trend lines were estimated using linear  regression. RESULTS: During 2002-2011, cancer caused about 20% of all deaths each  year in central Serbia. More men (56.9%) than women (43.1%) died of cancer. The  average mortality rate for men was 1.3 times higher compared to women. A  significant trend of increase of the age-adjusted mortality rates was recorded  both for males (p<0.001) and for females (p=0.02). Except gastric cancer, the  age-adjusted mortality rates in men were significantly increased for lung cancer  (p=0.02), colorectal cancer (p<0.05), prostate cancer (p=0.01) and pancreatic  cancer (p=0.01). Age-adjusted mortality rates for breast cancer in females were  remarkably increased (p=0.01), especially after 2007. CONCLUSIONS: In central  Serbia during the period from 2002 to 2011, there was an increasing trend in  mortality rates due to cancers in both sexes. Cancer mortality in males was  1.3-fold higher compared to females.","['Markovic-Denic, Ljiljana', 'Cirkovic, Andia', 'Zivkovic, Snezana', 'Stanic, Danica', 'Skodric-Trifunovic, Vesna']",
Tobacco smoking trends in Samoa over four decades: can continued globalization rectify that which it has wrought?,"BACKGROUND: The island country of Samoa (population 188,000 in 2011) forms part of Polynesia in the South Pacific. Over the past several decades Samoa has  experienced exceptional modernization and globalization of many sectors of  society, with noncommunicable diseases (NCD) now the leading cause of morbidity  and mortality. The evolution of risk factor prevalence underpinning the increase  in NCDs, however, has not been well described, including tobacco smoking which is  related to cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary  disease. METHODS: The present study examines tobacco smoking in relation to  different forms and effects of globalization in Samoa using 7 population-based  surveys (n = 9223) over 1978-2013. RESULTS: The prevalence of daily tobacco  smoking steadily decreased over 1978-2013 from 76% to 36% in men, and from 27% to  15% in women (p < 0.0001 both sexes). During 1991-2013, current tobacco smoking  also steadily decreased from 64% to 40% in men (p < 0.0001), and from 21% to 17%  in women (p < 0.05). Declines were similar in younger (25-44 years) and older  (45-64 years) men and women. Colonial globalization facilitated the introduction  and prolific spread of tobacco trade and consumption in the Pacific Islands from  the sixteenth century, with many populations inexorably pulled into trade  relations and links to the global economy. It has also been a different  globalization which may have led to the decline in smoking prevalence in Samoa in  recent decades, through global dissemination since the 1950s of information on  the harmful effects of tobacco smoking derived from research studies in the USA  and Europe. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past 35 years tobacco smoking has steadily  declined among Samoan adults; the only NCD risk factor to demonstrate marked  declines during this period. By 2013 tobacco smoking in women had decreased to  levels similar to Australia and New Zealand (ANZ), however in men smoking  prevalence remained more than three times higher than ANZ. The impact on smoking  prevalence of the variety of tobacco control interventions that have been  implemented so far in Samoa need to be evaluated in order to determine the most  effective initiatives that should be prioritized and strengthened.","['Linhart, Christine', 'Naseri, Take', 'Lin, Sophia', 'Taylor, Richard', 'Morrell, Stephen', 'McGarvey, Stephen T.', 'Magliano, Dianna J.', 'Zimmet, Paul']",10.1186/s12992-017-0256-2
Event-free survival as a predictor of overall survival and recurrence burden of patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving neoadjuvant therapy.,"OBJECTIVES: Event-free survival has replaced overall survival as a primary end point in many recent and ongoing clinical trials. This study aims to examine the  correlation between real-world event-free survival and overall survival and to  assess the clinical and economic burden associated with disease recurrence among  patients with resected stage II to III non-small cell lung cancer who received  neoadjuvant therapy in the United States. METHODS: This retrospective study used  the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare database (2007-2019) to  identify patients with newly diagnosed, resected, stage II to IIIB (N2) non-small  cell lung cancer who received neoadjuvant therapy. The correlation between  real-world event-free survival and overall survival was assessed using the normal  scores rank correlation and landmark analysis. Overall survival, all-cause health  care resource use and costs, and non-small cell lung cancer-related health care  resource use and costs were compared between patients with and without  recurrence. RESULTS: A total of 221 patients met the eligibility criteria (median  follow-up time from neoadjuvant treatment initiation: 32.7 months). The mean age  was 72.1 years, and 57.0% of patients were male. Real-world, event-free survival  and overall survival are positively and significantly correlated (0.68; 95% CI,  0.52-0.79). Patients with recurrence had significantly shorter median overall  survival (19.3 vs 116.9 months), 4.59 times increased risk of death (95% CI,  2.56-8.26), and significantly higher all-cause and non-small cell lung  cancer-related health care resource use and costs (adjusted mean monthly costs  per patient difference: $5758 and $3187, respectively [all P < .001]).  CONCLUSIONS: These findings help validate event-free survival as a clinically  meaningful end point and strong predictor for overall survival and highlight the  need for additional novel therapies that may delay or prevent recurrence in  resectable stage II and III non-small cell lung cancer.","['Donington, Jessica', 'Hu, Xiaohan', 'Zhang, Su', 'Song, Yan', 'Arunachalam, Ashwini', 'Chirovsky, Diana', 'Gao, Chi', 'Lerner, Ari', 'Jiang, Anya', 'Signorovitch, James', 'Samkari, Ayman']",10.1016/j.jtcvs.2023.12.006
Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) Lobectomy for Pathologic Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Comparative Study with Thoracotomy Lobectomy.,"BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be performed either by thoracotomy or by employing video-assisted thoracic  surgery (VATS). The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of VATS  lobectomy for pathologic stage I NSCLC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between December  2003 and December 2007, 529 patients with pathologic stage I NSCLC underwent  lobectomies (373 thoracotomy, 156 VATS). Patients in both groups were selected  after being matched by age, gender and pathologic stage using propensity score  method, to create two comparable groups: thoracotomy and VATS groups, and the  overall survival, recurrence-free survival, complication and length of  hospitalization were compared between these two groups. RESULTS: After the  patients were matched by age, gender and pathologic stage, 272 patients remained  eligible for analysis, 136 in each group (mean age of 59.5 years; 70 men, 66  women; 80 stage IA, 56 stage IB). There was no statistical difference in other  preoperative clinical characteristics between the two groups. No hospital  mortality was observed in both groups. Overall 3-year survival rate was 97.4% in  thoracotomy group and 96.6% in VATS groups (p=0.76). During the follow-up, 20  patients (14.7%) developed recurrence in thoracotomy group, including loco-  regional recurrence in 7, distant metastasis in 13. In VATS group, 13 patients  (9.6%) developed recurrence, including loco-regional recurrence in 4, distant  metastasis in 9. Three-year recurrence-free survival rate was 81.8% in  thoracotomy group and 85.3% in VATS groups (p=0.43). There was no significant  difference in postoperative complications between thoracotomy and VATS groups (30  cases in 22 patients vs. 19 cases in 17 patients, p=0.65, odds ratio=1.19). The  mean hospital stay of VATS group was 2 days shorter than that of thoracotomy  group (8.8±6.5 days vs. 6.3±3.3 days, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: VATS lobectomy for  pathologic stage I lung cancer is a feasible operation with shorter  hospitalization, while surgical outcome is comparable to thoracotomy lobectomy.","['Park, Joon Suk', 'Kim, Kwhanmien', 'Choi, Min Suk', 'Chang, Sung Wook', 'Han, Woo-Sik']",10.5090/kjtcs.2011.44.1.32
First- and second-line treatment of advanced metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer: a global view.,"Treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer is dependent on disease stage. For patients with metastasis or locally advanced disease, the importance of finding  therapeutic schemes that may benefit this population is important. This review  discusses therapeutic options for first- and second-line treatment in patients  with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. According to current data, the  combination of two cytotoxic agents is the optimum first-line treatment for  patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and performance status of 0-1. Addition  of bevacizumab has shown to provide an even longer survival and to increase  response rate. Within the first-line setting, erlotinib appears to be effective  in the treatment of elderly patients who would not derive a benefit from standard  chemotherapy or those refusing standard chemotherapy. The administration of  erlotinib as first-line maintenance therapy is being assessed. There are  currently three drugs approved for second-line treatment of patients with  advanced non-small-cell lung cancer after failure of first-line chemotherapy.  These drugs have proven to be effective in phase III trials. In the phase III  trial BR.21 study, the response rate was 8.9% in the erlonitib group, and less  than 1% in placebo; median response duration was 7.9 months and 3.7 months,  respectively; and the median survival was 6.7 months and 4.7 with erlotinib and  placebo, respectively. One-year survival was 31% and 21% with erlotinib and  placebo, respectively. In addition, the BR.21 trial revealed that significantly  greater improvements in overall quality of life and in both physical and  emotional functioning were observed in the erlotinib arm as compared with the  placebo arm. Erlotinib is not significantly associated with hematologic adverse  effects. Erlotinib is administered orally, and does not require concomitant  administration of other drugs, thus causing patients less inconvenience. Analysis  of data from different subgroups included in the BR.21 trial show that overall  survival is similar among women and men, among patients with adenocarcinoma and  epidermoid carcinoma or Asian patients compared with other ethnicities.  Combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab in the second-line treatment of patients  with advanced disease has been evaluated as anti-angiogenic properties. This  combination therapy has provided promising results which should be confirmed in  future studies.","['Thatcher, Nicholas']",10.1186/1753-6561-2-s2-s3
Evaluation of Treatment Efficacy of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Rare Single EGFR Exon 21 L861Q Mutation: Single Center Experience.,"OBJECTIVE: Epidermal growth factor receptor mutations are the second most common oncogenic driver event in non-small cell lung cancer. We aimed to compare the  first generation erlotinib treatment with the second generation afatinib  treatment in patients with non- small cell lung cancer with epidermal growth  factor receptor exon 21 L861Q mutation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Progression-free  survival and overall survival of 30 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated  with erlo- tinib or afatinib due to single epidermal growth factor receptor L861Q  positivity were compared retrospectively. The number of patients included in the  first, second, and third treatment line was 15 (50.0%), 11 (36.7%), and 4  (13.3%), respectively. RESULTS: There were 23 patients in the erlotinib arm and 7  patients in the afatinib arm. Median progression-free survival was 12.8 months in  the erlotinib group and 9.3 months in the afatinib group. Median overall survival  in erlotinib and afatinib groups was 77.9 months and 30.3 months, respectively.  No statistically significant difference was found in the comparison of these  survival times. CONCLUSION: Survival times of erlotinib and afatinib treatment  are similar in patients with a single epidermal growth factor receptor L861Q  mutation. In patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors treatment, the female  gender has a positive effect on progression-free survival, and being a non-smoker  has a positive effect on overall survival. In patients with rare mutation exon 21  L861Q positivity, both first-generation and second-generation tyrosine kinase  inhibitors should be considered.","['Gürsoy, Pınar', 'Çakar, Burcu', 'Ön, Sercan', 'Göker, Erdem', 'Nart, Deniz']",10.5152/TurkThoracJ.2022.21270
The changing pattern of non-small cell lung cancer between the 90 and 2000 decades.,"BACKGROUND: In Europe, approximately 381,500 patients are diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) every year. The aim of this study is to  analyse the changes in diagnosis, treatment and evolution during the last two  decades, using data from a hospital registry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients  diagnosed with NSCLC at the Corporació Sanitària Parc Taulí-Sabadell (Catalonia,  Spain) during the periods 1990-1997 (n=748) and 2003-2005 (n=311) were included.  The hospital tumour registry was used for prospective data collection. RESULTS:  Our series shows a significant increase in women diagnosed with NSCLC (6% vs  10.3%; p 0.01) in the latter period; the incidence of adenocarcinomas increased  by 20% (31% vs 51.1%), whereas that of squamous cell carcinomas fell (51.3% vs  32.5%; p<0.001). The proportion of patients receiving active treatment also  increased significantly, from 56.6% to 76.5% (p<0.001). Disease stage at  diagnosis and the number of patients treated by radical surgical resection  remained unchanged. Among the favourable independent prognostic factors for  survival were: gender (women), age less than 70 years old, Karnofsky index ≥70%,  early stage at diagnosis, treatment with chemotherapy, and being diagnosed in the  latter period 2003-2005 (HR 0.67). Over this 10-year period, absolute gain in  mean survival in our series was 115 days. CONCLUSIONS: The absolute gain in mean  survival in NSCLC patients in the period studied was 3.8 months, with a 6.75%  increase in 5-year survival. Hospital registry data may help the correct  assessment of epidemiological changes and the real effectiveness of treatments,  which are sometimes overestimated in clinical trials.","['Montesinos, Jesus', 'Bare, Marisa', 'Dalmau, Elsa', 'Saigi, Eugeni', 'Villace, Pablo', 'Nogue, Miquel', 'Angel Segui, Miquel', 'Arnau, Anna', 'Bonfill, Xavier']",10.2174/1874306401105010024
Changes of Brain Structure in Patients With Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer After Long-Term Target Therapy With EGFR-TKI.,"PURPOSE: Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy is the routine treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung  cancer (NSCLC) harboring positive EGFR mutations. Patients who undergo such  treatment have reported cognitive decline during follow-up. This study,  therefore, aimed to evaluate brain structural changes in patients receiving  EGFR-TKI to increase understanding of this potential symptom. METHOD: The medical  records of 75 patients with metastatic NSCLC (without brain metastasis or other  co-morbidities) who received EGFR-TKI therapy from 2010 to 2017 were reviewed.  The modified Scheltens Visual Scale and voxel-based morphometry were used to  evaluate changes in white matter lesions (WML) and gray matter volume (GMV),  respectively. RESULTS: The WML scores were higher at the 12-month [8.65 ± 3.86;  95% confidence interval (CI), 1.60-2.35; p < 0.001] and 24-month follow-ups  (10.11 ± 3.85; 95% CI, 2.98-3.87; p < 0.001) compared to baseline (6.68 ± 3.64).  At the 24-month follow-up, the visual scores were also significantly higher in  younger patients (3.89 ± 2.04) than in older patients (3.00 ± 1.78; p = 0.047)  and higher in female patients (3.80 ± 2.04) than in male patients (2.73 ± 1.56; p  = 0.023). Additionally, significant GMV loss was observed in sub-regions of the  right occipital lobe (76.71 voxels; 95% CI, 40.740-112.69 voxels), left occipital  lobe (93.48 voxels; 95% CI, 37.48-149.47 voxels), and left basal ganglia (37.57  voxels; 95% CI, 21.58-53.57 voxels) (all p < 0.005; cluster-level false discovery  rate < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: An increase in WMLs and loss of GMV were observed in  patients with metastatic NSCLC undergoing long-term EGFR-TKI treatment. This  might reflect an unknown side-effect of EGFR-TKI treatment. Further prospective  studies are necessary to confirm our findings.","['Yang, Beisheng', 'Luo, Chunli', 'Yu, Min', 'Zhou, Lin', 'Tao, Bo', 'Tang, Biqiu', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'Huang, Meijuan', 'Peng, Feng', 'Liu, Yongmei', 'Xu, Yong', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Zhou, Xiaojuan', 'Xue, Jianxin', 'Li, Yanying', 'Wang, Yongsheng', 'Li, Zhiping', 'Lu, You', 'Lui, Su', 'Gong, Youling']",10.3389/fonc.2020.573512
Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutation Status and the Impact on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status differs according to ethnicity, gender, smoking history, and histology types. The present study aimed  to evaluate EGFR mutation status in patients with non-small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) and further explore its association with clinical characteristics and  prognosis in advanced NSCLC patients (Stage IIIB-IV). 238 NSCLC patients were  enrolled in this study from October 2016 through December 2019. Patient  characteristics and clinical data including age, gender, smoking history,  histology types, tumor stage, survival status, and time were collected via  electronic medical record system or telephone. 21 somatic mutations which spanned  exons 18-21 of EGFR were detected using the amplification refractory mutation  system-polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method, followed by analysis of links  to clinical characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival  (OS). 103 patients were detected harboring EGFR mutations among the 238 cases  tested (43.3%), and exons 19 and 21 were the highest mutation frequencies, with  20.6% and 19.3% respectively. The EGFR mutation rate was much higher in female  versus male (57.4% vs 31.5%, p <0.001), in non-smokers compared to smokers (56.8%  vs 25.9%, p <0.001), and in those with adenocarcinoma than other histology types  (48.3% vs 3.7%, p <0.001). For patients in advanced stage, median PFS was 11  months in patients harboring EGFR mutations, versus 4 months in patients with  wild type EGFR (p <0.001); median OS was 24 versus 12 months (p <0.001). Never  smoking (p = 0.042) and adenocarcinoma (p = 0.007) were independent favorable  factors for EGFR mutations. Our data strengthen the findings of high prevalence  of EGFR mutations in Asian patients with NSCLC. Mutations are prevalent in those  patients who are female, adenocarcinoma, and have never smoked. Moreover,  advanced EGFR mutation-positive patients have better PFS and OS than those with  wild type EGFR.","['Huang, H. M.', 'Wei, Y.', 'Wang, J. J.', 'Ran, F. Y.', 'Wen, Y.', 'Chen, Q.

Cancer mortality pattern in Viet Nam.,"BACKGROUND: Health information in general and cancer information in particular in Viet Nam is an basic data for decisions related to health planning prevent  against cancer. However, very limited database of cancer information bas been  available to date. The aim of the present study was to examine cancer mortality  pattern nationwide in Viet Nam. METHODS: Descriptive cancer epidemiology was  designed for the present study. Both demographic data and list of all deaths  during the two years period, 2005-06, were obtained from all 10,769 commune  health stations. Five indicators included name, age, sex, date of death and cause  of death was collected for each case. A guideline to report demographic data of  each commune and information of each case who has been lived at least 6 months in  their commune was prepared in the designed form and sent by express mail service  to all the heads of 10,769 commune health stations throughout country. The data  comprises all cancer mortality records at the commune-level for the period  2005-06. All obtained data of cancer deaths as well as demographic information  was computed using Excel software. The Excel data was exported to STATA 8.0 for  cancer analysis. Cancer case was coded following ICD-10. RESULTS: To date, 94.6%  of the 10,769 communes (from the 638 of 671 districts within the 64 provinces)  have forwarded the required data and we currently have approximately 93,719  cancer deaths for the 2 years period. Number of person-year was 76,726,873 in  2005 and 77,902,688 in 2006. Number of cancer deaths was 45,413 (29,189 males and  16,224 females) in 2005 and 48,306 (31,447 males and 16,859 females) in 2006.  Male to female ratios were 1.8 and 1.9 in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Three most  common cancer sites numbered of 61,079 (65% of all 93,719 cancer deaths) included  25,410 liver cancer; 22,209 lung cancer; and 13,460 stomach cancer. Among both  males and females, liver cancer was ranked in the first most common (31,04% and  19.91%), followed by lung cancer (26.69% and 18.21%) and stomach (14.42% and  14.26%). Among females, cervix and other female genital cancers were ranked in  the four most common (9.13%) and breast cancer was about 5.69%. CONCLUSIONS:  Participated proportion of nationwide administration units and population was  over 90% to report about 93,719 deaths from cancer that suggested that cancer has  been highly concerned by social as well as people due to a number of thousand  life lost. This condition will accept well primary cancer prevention at commune  level in Viet Nam to eliminate the ancient disease of cancer in human.","['Ngoan, Le Tran', 'Lua, Nguyen Thi', 'Hang, Lai Thi Minh']",
Key Determinants of Health-Related Quality of Life Among Advanced Lung Cancer Patients: A Qualitative Study in Belgium and Italy.,"Background: The lung cancer (LC) treatment landscape has drastically expanded with the arrival of immunotherapy and targeted therapy. This new variety of  treatment options, each with its own characteristics, raises uncertainty  regarding the key aspects affecting patients' health-related quality of life  (HRQL). The present qualitative study aimed to investigate how LC patients  perceive their HRQL and the factors that they consider to be most influential in  determining their HRQL. Methods: This qualitative research incorporates four  focus group discussions, with six LC patients in each group. In total, 24 stage  III and IV LC patients were included in the discussions, with Italian (n = 12)  and Belgian (n = 12) patients, age range: 42-78, median age = 62 (IQR =  9.3 years), SD = 8.5; 62% men. Using thematic analysis, transcripts and notes  from the FGDs were analyzed using NVivo software (edition 12). Results: Three  main themes capturing determinants of HRQL were identified. First, patients  agreed on the importance of physical aspects (symptoms and side-effects) in  determining their HRQL. In particular, skin conditions, nausea, fatigue, risk of  infections, sensory abnormalities, pain, and changes in physical appearance were  highlighted. Second, patients worried about psychological aspects, negatively  impacting their wellbeing such as uncertainties regarding their future health  state, and a lower degree of autonomy and independence. Third, patients  underlined the importance of social aspects, such as communication with  healthcare providers and social interaction with friends, family and peers.  Conclusion: This study demonstrates that physical, psychological, and social  aspects are key factors driving LC patients' HRQL. Gaining a better understanding  of how LC patients perceive their HRQL and how it is affected by their illness  and therapy will aid patient-centric decision-making across the drug life cycle,  by providing stakeholders (drug developers, regulators, reimbursement bodies, and  clinicians) insights about the treatment and disease aspects of importance to LC  patients as well as the unmet needs LC patients may have regarding available  treatment modalities. Finally, this study underscores a need for individual  treatment decision-making that is considerate of uncertainties among LC patients  about their future health state, and ways for improving communication between  healthcare providers and patients to do so.","['Janssens, Rosanne', 'Arnou, Reinhard', 'Schoefs, Elise', 'Petrocchi, Serena', 'Cincidda, Clizia', 'Ongaro, Giulia', 'Oliveri, Serena', 'Smith, Meredith Y.', 'Louis, Evelyne', 'Vandevelde, Marie', 'Nackaerts, Kristiaan', 'Pravettoni, Gabriella', 'Huys, Isabelle']",10.3389/fphar.2021.710518
"Durvalumab Treatment Patterns for Patients with Unresectable Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA): A Nationwide,  Real-World Study.","BACKGROUND: Durvalumab is approved for the treatment of adults with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) post-chemoradiotherapy (CRT). This  real-world study describes patient characteristics and durvalumab treatment  patterns (number of doses and therapy duration; treatment initiation delays,  interruptions, discontinuations, and associated reasons) among VHA-treated  patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of adults with  unresectable stage III NSCLC receiving durvalumab at the VHA between 1 January  2017 and 30 June 2020. Patient characteristics and treatment patterns were  presented descriptively. RESULTS: A total of 935 patients were included (median  age: 69 years; 95% males; 21% Blacks; 46% current smokers; 16% ECOG performance  scores ≥ 2; 50% squamous histology). Durvalumab initiation was delayed in 39% of  patients (n = 367). Among the 200 patients with recorded reasons, delays were  mainly due to physician preference (20%) and CRT toxicity (11%). Overall,  patients received a median (interquartile range) of 16 (7-24) doses of durvalumab  over 9.0 (2.9-11.8) months. Treatment interruptions were experienced by 19% of  patients (n = 180), with toxicity (7.8%) and social reasons (2.6%) being the most  cited reasons. Early discontinuation occurred in 59% of patients (n = 551),  largely due to disease progression (24.2%) and toxicity (18.2%). CONCLUSIONS:  These real-world analyses corroborate PACIFIC study results in terms of the main  reasons for treatment discontinuation in a VHA population with worse prognostic  factors, including older age, predominantly male sex, and poorer performance  score. One of the main reasons for durvalumab initiation delays, treatment  interruptions, or discontinuations was due to toxicities. Patients could benefit  from improved strategies to prevent, identify, and manage CRT and durvalumab  toxicities timely and effectively.","['Moore, Amanda M.', 'Nooruddin, Zohra', 'Reveles, Kelly R.', 'Datta, Paromita', 'Whitehead, Jennifer M.', 'Franklin, Kathleen', 'Alkadimi, Munaf', 'Williams, Madison H.', 'Williams, Ryan A.', 'Smith, Sarah', 'Reichelderfer, Renee', 'Cotarla, Ion', 'Brannman, Lance', 'Frankart, Andrew', 'Mulrooney, Tiernan', 'Hsieh, Kristin', 'Simmons, Daniel J.', 'Jones, Xavier', 'Frei, Christopher R.']",10.3390/curroncol30090611
"Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2006, featuring colorectal cancer trends and impact of interventions (risk factors, screening,  and treatment) to reduce future rates.","BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American  Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to provide  updated information regarding cancer occurrence and trends in the United States.  This year's report includes trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death  rates and highlights the use of microsimulation modeling as a tool for  interpreting past trends and projecting future trends to assist in cancer control  planning and policy decisions. METHODS: Information regarding invasive cancers  was obtained from the NCI, CDC, and NAACCR; and information on deaths was  obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percentage  changes in the age-standardized incidence and death rates (based on the year 2000  US population standard) for all cancers combined and for the top 15 cancers were  estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (1975-2006) and for  short-term fixed-interval trends (1997-2006). All statistical tests were 2-sided.  RESULTS: Both incidence and death rates from all cancers combined significantly  declined (P < .05) in the most recent time period for men and women overall and  for most racial and ethnic populations. These decreases were driven largely by  declines in both incidence and death rates for the 3 most common cancers in men  (ie, lung and prostate cancers and CRC) and for 2 of the 3 leading cancers in  women (ie, breast cancer and CRC). The long-term trends for lung cancer mortality  in women had smaller and smaller increases until 2003, when there was a change to  a nonsignificant decline. Microsimulation modeling demonstrates that declines in  CRC death rates are consistent with a relatively large contribution from  screening and with a smaller but demonstrable impact of risk factor reductions  and improved treatments. These declines are projected to continue if risk factor  modification, screening, and treatment remain at current rates, but they could be  accelerated further with favorable trends in risk factors and higher utilization  of screening and optimal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the decrease in overall  cancer incidence and death rates is encouraging, rising incidence and mortality  for some cancers are of concern.","['Edwards, Brenda K.', 'Ward, Elizabeth', 'Kohler, Betsy A.', 'Eheman, Christie', 'Zauber, Ann G.', 'Anderson, Robert N.', 'Jemal, Ahmedin', 'Schymura, Maria J.', 'Lansdorp-Vogelaar, Iris', 'Seeff, Laura C.', 'van Ballegooijen, Marjolein', 'Goede, S.

Clinicopathological Features and First-Line Treatment Outcomes of Geriatric Patients With Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Multicenter Study.,"Introduction The geriatric patient population diagnosed with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is underrepresented in clinical studies. We aimed  to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics, first-line treatment  patterns and treatment outcomes of patients aged 65 years or older with extensive  stage SCLC. Material and methods In this multicenter, retrospective cohort study,  patients aged 65 years or older, diagnosed with extensive-stage SCLC, between  January 2009 and December 2021 were included. Patients who were under 65 years of  age at the time of diagnosis and did not develop progression after curative  treatment and patients with a second malignancy were excluded from the study. The  clinicopathological characteristics, first-line treatment patterns and treatment  outcomes were analyzed. Results A total of 132 patients were included in the  study. The median age was 70 years (range:65-91), and 118 (89.4%) patients were  male. There were 77 (58.3%) patients with eastern cooperative oncology group  (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0-1. There were 26 (19.7%) patients in the  limited stage disease and 106 (80.3%) patients in the extensive stage disease at  the time of diagnosis. First-line chemotherapy was given to 86 (65.2%) patients.  Of the patients who could not receive treatment, 18 patients (13.6%) due to  patient refusal, and 28 patients (21.2%) due to comorbid diseases and poor  performance status with organ dysfunctions. The most common treatment regimen  used as first-line treatment was cisplatin+etoposide (n=47, 54.7%), and followed  by carboplatin+etoposide (n=39, 45.3%). First-line chemotherapy responses were  complete response in 4 (4.7%) patients, partial response in 35 (40.7%) patients,  stable disease in 13 (15.1%) patients, and progressive disease in 34 (39.5%)  patients. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events was neutropenia in 33 (38.4%)  patients. Forty nine patients (57.0%) completed the planned first-line treatment.  The mPFS was 6.1 months and the mOS was 8.2 months with first-line treatment. We  found that ECOG PS status was the most important negative prognostic factor for  both PFS and OS. There was no difference between carboplatin+etoposide and  cisplatin+etoposide regimens in terms of PFS, OS, adverse events and treatment  compliance. Conclusion Thus, it may be an appropriate approach not to give up  chemotherapy treatment easily in elderly patients with a diagnosis of extensive  stage SCLC. It should be kept in mind that finding factors that might affect the  prognosis and tailoring the tretment precisely on case-by-case basis in geriatric  cancer patients have an impact on survival.","['İlhan, Aysegul', 'Gurler, Fatih', 'Yilmaz, Funda', 'Seyran, Erdogan', 'Bastug, Vural', 'Gorgulu, Bugra', 'Eraslan, Emrah', 'Yıldırım, Özgen Ahmet', 'Yazici, Ozan', 'Çakmak Öksüzoğlu, Ömür Berna']",10.7759/cureus.35710
"Prevalence, associations, and adequacy of treatment of major depression in patients with cancer: a cross-sectional analysis of routinely collected clinical  data.","BACKGROUND: Major depression is an important complication of cancer. However, reliable data are lacking for the prevalence of depression in patients with  cancer in different primary sites, the association of depression with demographic  and clinical variables within cancer groupings, and the proportion of depressed  patients with cancer receiving potentially effective treatment for depression. We  investigated these questions with data from a large representative clinical  sample. METHODS: We analysed data from patients with breast, lung, colorectal,  genitourinary, or gynaecological cancer who had participated in routine screening  for depression in cancer clinics in Scotland, UK between May 12, 2008, and Aug  24, 2011. Depression screening was done in two stages (first, Hospital Anxiety  and Depression Scale; then, major depression section of the Structured Clinical  Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th  Edition). Data for depression status were linked with demographic and clinical  data obtained from the Scottish National Cancer Registry. FINDINGS: We analysed  data for 21 151 patients. The prevalence of major depression was highest in  patients with lung cancer (13·1%, 95% CI 11·9-14·2%), followed by gynaecological  cancer (10·9%, 9·8-12·1), breast cancer (9·3%, 8·7-10·0), colorectal cancer  (7·0%, 6·1-8·0), and genitourinary cancer (5·6%, 4·5-6·7). Within these cancer  groupings, a diagnosis of major depression was more likely in patients who were  younger, had worse social deprivation scores, and, for lung cancer and colorectal  cancer, female patients. 1130 (73%) of 1538 patients with depression and complete  patient-reported treatment data were not receiving potentially effective  treatment. INTERPRETATION: Major depression is common in patients attending  cancer clinics and most goes untreated. A pressing need exists to improve the  management of major depression for patients attending specialist cancer services.

Detection of EGFR and BRAF mutations by competitive allele-specific TaqMan polymerase chain reaction in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung  cancer (NSCLC) expressing sensitive EGFR-mutants. Other drugs target different  driver mutants, including the serine/threonine-protein kinase B-raf (BRAF)  inhibitor dabrafenib, which has exhibited promising efficacy for treating  patients with metastatic BRAF-mutated NSCLC. Therefore, identifying patients  carrying mutations that may be treated using targeted therapies is important.  However, the methods of molecular detection presently applied in clinical  practice, particularly detection of BRAF in NSCLC patients, require further  investigation. Therefore, more sensitive and economic methods are required. The  present study applied the competitive allele-specific TaqMan polymerase chain  reaction (CastPCR) technology to the molecular detection of EGFR (del2235-2249,  del2236-2250, T790M, L858R) and BRAF (V600E, G469A, D594G) mutations in 144  treatment-naive patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and analyzed the association  between the mutation rates and patients' clinicopathological features. 51.4%  (74/144) cases were identified harboring EGFR mutations. A total of 40.3%  (58/144) patients carried sensitizing mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R) and  14.6% (21/144) carried T790M mutations. 6.9% (10/144) mutation-positive patients  were double-mutated. Total EGFR mutation rate was significantly increased in  female compared with that of males (60.9 vs. 43.8%, P<0.05), in non-smokers  compared with that of smokers (62.8 vs. 34.5%, P<0.05). In total, 8.3% (12/144)  patients were identified with BRAF mutations. 16.7% were V600E (2/12) and 83.3%  (10/12) were non-V600E mutants. Among the 10 non-V600E mutations, D594G accounted  for 90.0% (9/10) and G469A accounted for 10.0% (1/10). Statistical analysis  demonstrated that the BRAF mutation rate was not associated with any of the  following clinicopathological features: Sex, age, smoking history, clinical  stages, distant metastasis, differentiation degree, tumor size and regional lymph  node metastasis (P≥0.05). CastPCR technology is a robust method with high  sensitivity for the molecular detection of EGFR and BRAF mutations in clinical  formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples.","['Yang, Yang', 'Meng, Yi', 'Zhang, Hang', 'Shen, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Rutian', 'Yu, Lixia', 'Liu, Baorui', 'Wang, Lifeng']",10.3892/ol.2017.7652
Prognostic role of minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production slope for perioperative morbidity and long-term survival in resectable patients with  nonsmall-cell lung cancer: a prospective study using propensity score overlap  weighting.,"BACKGROUND: The role of minute ventilation/carbon dioxide production ( / CO 2 ) slope, a ventilation efficiency marker, in predicting short-term and long-term  health outcomes for patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing  lung resection has not been well investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This  prospective cohort study consecutively enrolled NSCLC patients who underwent a  presurgical cardiopulmonary exercise test from November 2014 to December 2019.  The association of / CO 2 slope with relapse-free survival (RFS), overall  survival (OS), and perioperative mortality was evaluated using the Cox  proportional hazards and logistic models. Covariates were adjusted using  propensity score overlap weighting. The optimal cut-off point of the E/ CO 2  slope was estimated using the receiver operating characteristics curve. Internal  validation was completed through bootstrap resampling. RESULTS: A cohort of 895  patients [median age (interquartile range), 59 (13) years; 62.5% male] was  followed for a median of 40 (range, 1-85) months. Throughout the study, there  were 247 relapses or deaths and 156 perioperative complications. The incidence  rates per 1000 person-years for relapses or deaths were 108.8 and 79.6 among  patients with high and low E/ CO 2 slopes, respectively [weighted incidence rate  difference per 1000 person-years, 29.21 (95% CI, 7.30-51.12)]. A E/ CO 2 slope of  greater than or equal to 31 was associated with shorter RFS [hazard ratio for  relapse or death, 1.38 (95% CI, 1.02-1.88), P =0.04] and poorer OS [hazard ratio  for death, 1.69 (1.15-2.48), P =0.02] compared to a lower / CO 2 slope. A high E/  CO 2 slope increased the risk of perioperative morbidity compared with a low E/  CO 2 slope [odds ratio, 2.32 (1.54-3.49), P <0.001]. CONCLUSIONS: In patients  with operable NSCLC, a high E/ CO 2 slope was significantly associated with  elevated risks of poorer RFS, OS, and perioperative morbidity.","['Dun, Yaoshan', 'Wu, Shaoping', 'Cui, Ni', 'Thomas, Randal J.', 'Squires, Ray W.', 'Olson, Thomas P.', 'Sylvester, Karl P.', 'Fu, Siqian', 'Zhang, Chunfang', 'Gao, Yang', 'Du, Yang', 'Xu, Ning', 'Liu, Suixin']",10.1097/JS9.0000000000000509
Palliative radiotherapy regimens for patients with thoracic symptoms from non‐small cell lung cancer,"Abstract - Background Palliative radiotherapy to the chest is often used in patients with lung cancer, but radiotherapy regimens are more often based on tradition than research results. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and previously updated in 2006. Objectives The two objectives of this review were: 1. To assess the effects of different palliative radiotherapy regimens on improving thoracic symptoms in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for radical RT given with curative intent. 2. To assess the effects of radiotherapy dose on overall survival in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non‐small cell lung cancer who are not suitable for radical RT given with curative intent. Search methods The electronic databases MEDLINE (1966 ‐ Jan 2014), EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists, handsearching of journals and conference proceedings, and discussion with experts were used to identify potentially eligible trials, published and unpublished. Two authors (FM and RS) independently identified all studies that may be suitable for inclusion in the review. We updated the search up to January 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled clinical trials comparing different regimens of palliative thoracic radiotherapy in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer. Data collection and analysis The reviewers assessed search results independently and possible studies were highlighted and the full text obtained. Data were extracted and attempts were made to contact the original authors for missing information. The primary outcome measure was improvement in major thoracic symptoms (degree and duration). Secondary outcome measures were short and long term toxicities, effect on quality of life and overall survival. Patient reported outcomes were reported descriptively. Quantitative data such as survival and toxicity were analysed as dichotomous variables and reported using relative risks (RR). For this update of the review a meta‐analysis of the survival data was carried out. Main results Fourteen randomised controlled trials (3576 patients) were included, with no new studies added in this update. There were important differences in the doses of radiotherapy investigated, the patient characteristics including disease stage and performance status and the outcome measures.The doses of RT investigated ranged from 10 Gy in 1 fraction (10Gy/1F) to 60 Gy/30F over six weeks, with a total of 19 different dose/ fractionation regimens. Potential biases were identified in some studies. Methods of randomisation, assessment of symptoms and statistical methods used were unclear in some papers. Withdrawal and drop‐outs were accounted for in all but one study. All 13 studies that investigated symptoms reported that major thoracic symptoms improved following RT.There is no strong evidence that any regimen gives greater palliation. Higher dose regimens may give more acute toxicity and some regimens are associated with an increased risk of radiation myelitis. Variation in reporting of toxicities, in particular the absence of clear grading, means results of the meta‐analysis should be treated with caution. Meta‐analysis of overall survival broken down by performance status, a key variable, is included in this update. Further information was sought from all the original authors if stratified data was not included in the original publication. Three published studies contained sufficient data and seven authors were able to provide further information which represented 1992 patients (56% of all patients). The absence of data for nearly half of the patients has affected the quality of evidence. The meta‐analysis showed no significant difference in 1‐year overall survival between regimens with fewer radiotherapy fractions compared with regimens with more when patients were stratified by performance status. The results of the meta‐analysis of 1‐year overall survival for patients with good performance status (WHO performance status 0‐1) showed moderately high heterogeneity and a summary result was not thought meaningful. The results of 1‐year overall survival for patients with poor performance status was RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; moderate quality of evidence). Authors' conclusions Radiotherapy for patients with incurable non‐small cell lung cancer can improve thoracic symptoms. Care should be taken with the dose to the spinal cord to reduce the risk of radiation myelopathy. The higher dose, more fractionated palliative radiotherapy regimens do not provide better or more durable palliation and their use to prolong survival is not supported by strong evidence. More research is needed into reducing the acute toxicity of large fraction regimens and into the role of radical compared to high dose palliative radiotherapy. In the future, large trials comparing different RT regimens may be difficult to set up because of the increasing use of systemic chemotherapy. Trials looking at how best to integrate these two modalities, particularly in good PS patients, need to be carried out. Plain language summary Comparing the effect of different courses of radiotherapy to the chest for patients with incurable lung cancer Review Question What is the best way to give radiotherapy to patients with incurable lung cancer. What doses give the best balance between symptom control and side effects? Does giving more radiotherapy improve the chance of a patient being alive in one or two years? Background In most developed countries lung cancer is one of the commonest tumours. Only 10 to 20% of patients can have surgery with a chance of cure. For many of the rest radiotherapy to the chest is used to relieve symptoms of cough, breathlessness and pain. The number of radiotherapy treatments given and the dose of each treatment varies widely around the world. Since the late 1980s, many trials have tried to answer which is the best radiotherapy schedule to relieve symptoms without causing too many side‐effects. Study Characteristics Fourteen trials, including 3576 patients, were found that compared at least two different radiotherapy regimens. All involved patients with incurable lung cancer but the extent of the cancer and the fitness of the patients varied between the studies making direct comparisons difficult.The radiotherapy regimens in the trials varied from a single treatment to thirty treatments over six weeks.This update found no new trials and a meta‐analysis (pooling the results of all trials) was carried out to see whether giving higher doses of radiation resulted in longer survival. All trials reported how long patients lived after their treatment and looked at the effect on symptoms as well as recording side‐effects. However, the trials did not use the same methods for recording symptoms and side effects with some using the doctor's assessment and some using the patient's, making direct comparison difficult. Key Results This review shows that for most patients, a short course of radiotherapy with only one or two visits, improves common symptoms as effectively as longer courses, without more side effects. There is no strong evidence to support the view that a longer course of radiotherapy may give a better chance of living for one or two years, but it does result in more immediate side effects, especially sore swallowing. Quality of the Evidence All the trials were randomised meaning patients involved in the study had an equal chance of getting either treatment. The use of a doctor's assessment of the patient's symptoms in some studies may have led to an under‐estimation of the symptoms.","['Stevens, R', 'Macbeth, F', 'Toy, E', 'Coles, B', 'Lester, JF']",10.1002/14651858.CD002143.pub4
Similar outcomes between African American and non-African American patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung carcinoma: report from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B,"PURPOSE: Among patients with small‐cell lung carcinoma, African Americans have lower survival rates than non‐African Americans. We investigated whether the disparity in survival would persist when patients were treated with similar therapies (ie, phase II/III Cancer and Leukemia Group B [CALGB] trials). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed 995 patients (928 non‐African American and 67 African American) receiving chemotherapy in CALGB studies for extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC). Clinical and demographic characteristics, treatment received, and survival data were obtained from the CALGB database. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the effect of race/ethnicity on survival after adjustment for other known prognostic factors. All statistical tests were two sided. RESULTS: The unadjusted survival distribution of African American patients was not significantly different from that of non‐African American patients; median survival was 11.5 months (95% CI, 9.4 to 13.4 months) for African American patients versus 9.9 months (95% CI, 9.6 to 10.3 months) for non‐African American patients. Multivariable adjustment for the effect of treatment arm, histology, and metastatic site at presentation did not alter the outcome for African American patients. Survival was similar even though African American patients were more likely to have a poorer performance status, present with significant weight loss, and be Medicaid recipients (20% v 6%), which is an indicator of lower socioeconomic status. CONCLUSION: African American patients tended to present with prognostic features associated with a worse survival. However, when offered equivalent therapy, the outcome for African American patients was the same as that observed for non‐African American patients.","['Blackstock, AW', 'Herndon, JE', 'Paskett, ED', 'Miller, AA', 'Lathan, C', 'Niell, HB', 'Socinski, MA', 'Vokes, EE', 'Green, MR']",10.1200/JCO.2005.02.1436
Patterns of survival and recurrence after surgical treatment of early stage non-small cell lung carcinoma in the ACOSOG Z0030 (ALLIANCE) trial,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical resection has been the mainstay of curative treatment of early stage lung cancer in selected patients. We evaluated survival and patterns of recurrence after surgical resection for early stage lung cancer from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0030/Alliance trial. METHODS: One thousand eighteen patients enrolled in the Z0030 trial were analyzed according to clinical T stage. Differences between groups were compared using the 2‐sample rank test or χ(2) test. Log rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to compare survival and recurrence. To compare patients who underwent open versus video‐assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) resections, propensity‐score matched analysis was performed. Seven hundred fifty‐two patients (66 undergoing VATS and 686 undergoing open surgery) were classified into 5 equal‐sized propensity‐score groups. Proportional hazards regression was used to compare these outcomes. RESULTS: There were 578 patients with cT1 tumors and 440 patients with cT2 tumors. Median follow‐up was 6.7 years. Median overall survival was 9.1 years (stage T1) and 6.5 years (stage T2). Overall survival at 5 years was 72% (stage T1) and 55% (stage T2). Local recurrence‐free survival at 5 years was 95% (stage T1) and 91% (stage T2) (P = .015). Among patients with stage T1 cancer, 4.2% (23 out of 542) had local recurrences, whereas 7.3% (30 out of 409) of those with stage T2 tumors had local failure. There was no difference in the development of new primary tumors between stage T1 and stage T2 groups. In the propensity‐score matched analysis of VATS versus open lobectomy patients, there was no difference in overall survival, disease‐free survival, and freedom from development of a new primary tumor. CONCLUSIONS: Results of patients with resected early stage non‐small cell carcinoma from a large‐scale, multicenter trial serve as benchmarks against which to compare nonsurgical therapies for early stage lung cancer. Propensity‐score matched analysis shows no difference in survival between patients undergoing VATS and open lobectomy.","['Su, S', 'Scott, WJ', 'Allen, MS', 'Darling, GE', 'Decker, PA', 'McKenna, RJ', 'Meyers, BF']",10.1016/j.jtcvs.2013.10.001
Treatment Outcomes of Older Participants in a Randomized Trial Comparing Two Schedules of Twice-Daily Thoracic Radiotherapy in Limited-Stage SCLC,"Introduction: Half of the patients with limited‐stage SCLC (LS SCLC) are above or equal to 70 years old, but they account for less than 20% of participants in most trials. Comorbidities and reduced organ and physical function might lead to more treatment toxicity, and population‐based studies indicate that fewer older than younger patients with LS SCLC receive standard chemoradiotherapy, although there is limited evidence for such a policy. Methods: We compared baseline characteristics, comorbidity, survival, treatment completion, toxicity, health‐related quality of life, and treatment outcomes between patients above or equal to 70 years old and those younger than 70 years old in an open‐label, randomized phase II trial comparing twice‐daily thoracic radiotherapy of 45 Gy in 30 fractions with 60 Gy in 40 fractions in LS SCLC. All patients received concurrent i.v. cisplatin (75mg/m2) or carboplatin (AUC 5‐6 mg/ml x min) day 1 and i.v. etoposide (100 mg/m2) day 1‐3 chemotherapy. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02041845). Results: A total of 170 patients who were above or equal to 18 years old and had performance status of 0 to 2 were randomized. Of these, 53 patients (60 Gy: 25, 45 Gy: 28) were above or equal to 70 years old and 117 (60 Gy: 64, 45 Gy: 53) were younger. There were no differences in baseline characteristics, treatment completion rates, toxicity, or response rates across the age groups. Health‐related quality of life mean scores were similar during year one, but older patients reported more decline on functional scales than younger patients during year two. Overall survival was shorter for older patients, whereas there was no difference in progression‐free survival or time to progression. Conclusions: Patients above or equal to 70 years old tolerated concurrent twice‐daily chemoradiotherapy and achieved similar disease control as younger patients, indicating older patients should receive the same treatment as younger patients.","['Killingberg, KT', 'Gronberg, BH', 'Slaaen, M', 'Kirkevold, O', 'Halvorsen, TO']",10.1016/j.jtho.2023.01.012
Safety of Anlotinib Capsules Combined with PD-1 Inhibitor Camrelizumab in the Third-Line Treatment of Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer and Their Effect on Serum Tumor Markers,"Objective. To explore the safety of anlotinib capsules combined with the PD‐1 inhibitor (camrelizumab) in the third‐line treatment of advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and their effect on serum tumor markers. Methods. 88 patients with advanced NSCLC treated in the Oncology Department of our hospital from December 2018 to December 2019 were selected as research subjects and randomly and equally split into the single treatment group (STG) and combined treatment group (CTG). The levels of serum tumor markers after treatment were detected in both groups, and the incidence of adverse reactions during treatment was recorded. Results. Compared with the STG, CTG achieved obviously higher total effective rate (P < 0.05), lower total incidence of adverse reactions (P < 0.05), lower levels of serum tumor markers and average CFS score (P < 0.001), and higher average KPS score (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Application of anlotinib capsules combined with the PD‐1 inhibitor (camrelizumab) in the third‐line treatment of advanced NSCLC can effectively reduce the levels of serum tumor markers and cancer fatigue degree of patients, with a better effect than that of simple anlotinib treatment. In addition, further research of the combined treatment is helpful to establish a better therapeutic regimen for patients with advanced NSCLC.","['Wang, Y', 'Shi, X', 'Qi, Q', 'Ye, B', 'Zou, Z']",10.1155/2021/2338800
Hypofractionated palliative radiotherapy (17 Gy per two fractions) in advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma is comparable to standard fractionation for symptom control and survival: a national phase III trial,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether the effect of hypofractionated thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) is comparable to more standard fractionated radiotherapy (RT) in advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 421 patients with locally advanced stage III or stage IV NSCLC tumors were included. Inclusion criteria were inoperable, disease too advanced for curative radiotherapy, and chest symptoms or central tumor threatening the airways. Patients were randomly assigned to three arms: A, 17 Gy per two fractions (n = 146); B, 42 Gy per 15 fractions (n = 145); and C, 50 Gy per 25 fractions (n = 130). Four hundred seven patients were eligible for the study; 395 patients (97%) participated in the health‐related quality‐of‐life (HRQOL) study. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)‐C30 and EORTC QLQ‐lung cancer‐specific module (LC13) were used to investigate airway symptom relief and changes in HRQOL. Assessments were performed before TRT and until week 54. Clinicians' assessments of symptom improvement were at 2, 6, and 14 weeks after completion of TRT. The patients were observed for a minimum of 3 years. Results Baseline prognostic data were equally distributed in the treatment groups. Patient compliance with respect to the HRQOL investigation was minimum 74%. HRQOL and symptom relief were equivalent in the treatment arms. No significant difference in survival among arms A, B, and C was found, with median survival 8.2, 7.0, and 6.8 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that protracted palliative TRT renders no improvement in symptom relief, HRQOL, or survival when compared with short‐term hypofractionated treatment in advanced NSCLC.","['Sundstrøm, S', 'Bremnes, R', 'Aasebø, U', 'Aamdal, S', 'Hatlevoll, R', 'Brunsvig, P', 'Johannessen, DC', 'Klepp, O', 'Fayers, PM', 'Kaasa, S']",10.1200/JCO.2004.06.123
Study on the quality of life of patients with lung cancer by shunqi tongluo cream combined with the aidi,"Purpose and significance: By observing the clinical efficacy, adverse reactions and improvement of the quality of the patients' life of the study that The Shunqi Tongluo Cream combined with the Aidi explore new ideas and methods of treatment of lung cancer patients and provide the basis for the treatment of lung cancer and ultimately to improve the quality of life of patients with pleural effusion of lung cancer and prolong survival purposes. Methods: The patients diagnosed as lung cancer by means of the theory and/ or histological examination and accompanied with the symptoms of chest tightness and shortness of breath were randomly divided into treatment group and control group, and each group included 20 cases of patient. The patients in the control group were intervened by the Aidi injection alone while the patients in the observation group were intervened by the Shunqi Tongluo Cream combined with the Aidi injection, and the treatment efficacy and adverse reactions of the two groups were recorded. Results: After treatment, 20 cases of patients of the treatment group included 15 patients of Complete Response (CR), 15 patients of SD and 5 patients of No Response (NR), of which the total effective rate was 75.0%, while 20 cases of patients of the treatment group included 0 patients of Complete Response (CR), 11 patients of Stable Disease (SD) and 9 patients of No Response (NR), of which the total effective rate was equal to 55.0%. There was statistical significance (P=0.01<0.05) between the total effective rates of two group. Conclusion: 1. For the lung cancer patients with the symptom of chest tightness and shortness of breath, the efficacy of Shunqi Tongluo Cream combined with the Aidi injection is better than that of the Aidi injection alone. 2. The Shunqi Tongluo Cream combined with the Aidi injection can better relieve the symptoms. The observation demonstrated that the therapy by means of the Aidi injection combined with the TCM Shunqi Tongluo Cream topical application plus heat irritation possesses unique therapeutic advantages and has the value of clinical promotion and application.","['Lu, Y', 'Jia, Y', 'Xiao, H', 'Li, M', 'Sun, S', 'Chen, Z', 'Cheng, Q', 'Tang, H']",
The UK Lung Cancer Screening Trial: a pilot randomised controlled trial of low-dose computed tomography screening for the early detection of lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer kills more people than any other cancer in the UK (5‐year survival < 13%). Early diagnosis can save lives. The USA‐based National Lung Cancer Screening Trial reported a 20% relative reduction in lung cancer mortality and 6.7% all‐cause mortality in low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT)‐screened subjects. OBJECTIVES: To (1) analyse LDCT lung cancer screening in a high‐risk UK population, determine optimum recruitment, screening, reading and care pathway strategies; and (2) assess the psychological consequences and the health‐economic implications of screening. DESIGN: A pilot randomised controlled trial comparing intervention with usual care. A population‐based risk questionnaire identified individuals who were at high risk of developing lung cancer (≥ 5% over 5 years). SETTING: Thoracic centres with expertise in lung cancer imaging, respiratory medicine, pathology and surgery: Liverpool Heart & Chest Hospital, Merseyside, and Papworth Hospital, Cambridgeshire. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 50‐75 years, at high risk of lung cancer, in the primary care trusts adjacent to the centres. INTERVENTIONS: A thoracic LDCT scan. Follow‐up computed tomography (CT) scans as per protocol. Referral to multidisciplinary team clinics was determined by nodule size criteria. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Population‐based recruitment based on risk stratification; management of the trial through web‐based database; optimal characteristics of CT scan readers (radiologists vs. radiographers); characterisation of CT‐detected nodules utilising volumetric analysis; prevalence of lung cancer at baseline; sociodemographic factors affecting participation; psychosocial measures (cancer distress, anxiety, depression, decision satisfaction); and cost‐effectiveness modelling. RESULTS: A total of 247,354 individuals were approached to take part in the trial; 30.7% responded positively to the screening invitation. Recruitment of participants resulted in 2028 in the CT arm and 2027 in the control arm. A total of 1994 participants underwent CT scanning: 42 participants (2.1%) were diagnosed with lung cancer; 36 out of 42 (85.7%) of the screen‐detected cancers were identified as stage 1 or 2, and 35 (83.3%) underwent surgical resection as their primary treatment. Lung cancer was more common in the lowest socioeconomic group. Short‐term adverse psychosocial consequences were observed in participants who were randomised to the intervention arm and in those who had a major lung abnormality detected, but these differences were modest and temporary. Rollout of screening as a service or design of a full trial would need to address issues of outreach. The health‐economic analysis suggests that the intervention could be cost‐effective but this needs to be confirmed using data on actual lung cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The UK Lung Cancer Screening (UKLS) pilot was successfully undertaken with 4055 randomised individuals. The data from the UKLS provide evidence that adds to existing data to suggest that lung cancer screening in the UK could potentially be implemented in the 60‐75 years age group, selected via the Liverpool Lung Project risk model version 2 and using CT volumetry‐based management protocols. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN78513845. FUTURE WORK: The UKLS data will be pooled with the NELSON (Nederlands Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek: Dutch‐Belgian Randomised Lung Cancer Screening Trial) and other European Union trials in 2017 which will provide European mortality and cost‐effectiveness data. For now, there is a clear need for mortality results from other trials and further research to identify optimal methods of implementation and delivery. Strategies for increasing uptake and providing support for underserved groups will be key to implementation.

Cisplatin/etoposide versus carboplatin/etoposide chemotherapy and irradiation in small cell lung cancer: a randomized phase III study. Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group for Lung Cancer Trials,"The efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin/etoposide and carboplatin/etoposide combinations along with thoracic irradiation were prospectively assessed in patients with small cell lung cancer. Both combinations were equally effective. However, the carboplatin/etoposide regimen caused significantly less nausea, vomiting, nephrotoxicity, and neurotoxicity, and it was easier to administer. Dose intensity and treatment delays were similar in both groups. Thoracic irradiation given concurrently with chemotherapy is feasible and seems to offer a survival advantage. The relapse rate also is lower among patients who have received radiation therapy, and recurrences tended to be outside of the lung. Overall, a survival benefit was identified for patients aged between 50 and 65 years who had limited disease, good performance status, and only one metastatic site. Prophylactic brain irradiation in a subset of patients reduced brain metastasis, but the difference did not reach significance. From this trial, it is concluded that carboplatin/etoposide combination therapy is highly effective and is well tolerated by patients with small cell lung cancer. In limited disease, this combination can be given concurrently with thoracic irradiation and offers a survival advantage.","['Kosmidis, PA', 'Samantas, E', 'Fountzilas, G', 'Pavlidis, N', 'Apostolopoulou, F', 'Skarlos, D']",
Multiple-drug weekly chemotherapy versus standard combination regimen in small-cell lung cancer: a phase III randomized study conducted by the European Lung Cancer Working Party,"PURPOSE: A randomized trial was conducted in patients with small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) to determine if survival can be improved by a weekly chemotherapy regimen combining various drugs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty‐three patients were randomized to receive either six courses of a multiple‐drug combination (MDC) regimen (Adriamycin [ADR; doxorubicin; Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy] 25 mg/m2 intravenously [i.v.] on day 1; etoposide [VP16] 120 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1; cyclophosphamide [CPA] 500 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1; cisplatin 60 mg/m2 i.v. on day 8; vindesine [VDS] 3 mg/m2 i.v. on day 8; vincristine [VCR] 2 mg i.v. on day 15; methotrexate [MTX] 100 mg/m2 i.v. on day 15), or a standard chemotherapy (SC) regimen (ADR 50 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1; CPA 1 g/m2 i.v. on day 1; VP16 80 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 to 3). RESULTS: In 98 MDC‐treated and 101 SC‐treated assessable patients, we observed 69% and 62% objective responses rates, respectively. There was no significant difference in survival, with median durations and 2‐year overall survival rates of 49 and 43 weeks and 8.5% and 7.9%, respectively. There was a significant increase in response rate in favor of MDC patients with limited disease (84% v 62%). Toxicity was tolerable, although SC was more hematotoxic, with 76% (v 59%) experiencing leukopenia and 17% (v 7%) experiencing thrombocytopenia (grades III and IV). If the cumulative doses received were nearly equal to the scheduled cumulative doses in both arms, the total relative dose‐intensity (RDI) was significantly higher in the SC arm. The difference was due to increased treatment delays in the MDC arm. CONCLUSION: Weekly MDC failed to improve survival rates in patients with SCLC.","['Sculier, JP', 'Paesmans, M', 'Dabouis, G', 'Libert, P', 'Vandermoten, G', 'Van Cutsem, O', 'Berchier, MC', 'Ries, F', 'Michel, J']",10.1200/JCO.1993.11.10.1858
How to improve loco-regional control in stages IIIa-b NSCLC? Results of a three-armed randomized trial from the Swedish Lung Cancer Study Group,"BACKGROUND: A combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the treatment base for locally advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, both loco‐regional and distant failure is frequent. Attempts to improve the loco‐regional control were made in three separate phase II studies in Swedish University Hospitals, where accelerated radiotherapy or concurrent daily or weekly chemotherapy with conventional radiotherapy were tested. Comparatively good results from these studies lead to this national randomized phase II study, the RAKET‐study, where the different concepts were investigated on a wider basis for further phase III studies. METHODS: Inoperable stage III non‐small cell lung cancer patients in good performance status (PS<2) were equally randomized to either of three arms in eight institutions. All arms started with two cycles of induction chemotherapy: paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC6. Arm A: a third identical cycle was given concomitant with start of accelerated radiotherapy, 1.7 Gy BID to 64.6 Gy in 4.5 weeks. Arm B consisted of daily concomitant paclitaxel 12 mg/m2 with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy: 2 Gy to 60 Gy in 6 weeks. Arm C: weekly concomitant paclitaxel 60 mg/m2 and identical radiotherapy to 60 Gy. Primary endpoint: TTP. Secondary: OS, toxicity, QL and relapse pattern. RESULTS: Between June 2002 and May 2005 152 patients were randomized and of them 151 were evaluable: 78 men and 73 women, median age 62 years (43‐78), 55% had performance status 0 and 45% PS 1. Thirty‐four percent had stage IIIa and 66% IIIb. Histology: adenocarcinoma 48%, squamous cell carcinoma 32% and 20% non‐small cell carcinoma. The three arms were well balanced. Toxicity was manageable with 12% grades 3‐4 esophagitis, 1% grades 3‐4 pneumonitis and there was no clear difference between the arms. The QL data did not differ either. Median time to progression was 9.8 (8.3‐12.7) months (8.8, 10.3 and 9.3 months for arms A, B and C, respectively). Median survival was 17.8 (14.4‐23.7) months (17.7, 17.7 and 20.6 months for A, B and C, respectively). The 1‐, 3‐ and 5‐year overall survival was 63, 31 and 24%. Sixty‐nine percent of the patients relapsed with distant metastases initially and 31% had loco‐regional tumor progression, without significant differences between treatment arms. Thirty‐four percent developed brain metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment results are quite equal by intensifying the loco‐regional treatment either by accelerated fractionated radiotherapy or daily or weekly concomitant chemo‐radiotherapy both in terms of survival, toxicity and quality of life. The optimal treatment schedule for patients with locally advanced NSCLC is still to be decided and investigated in future clinical studies. Relapse pattern with distant metastases and especially brain metastases is a great problem and need further research for better therapy options and higher cure rate for this patient group.","['Nyman, J', 'Friesland, S', 'Hallqvist, A', 'Seke, M', 'Bergström, S', 'Thaning, L', 'Lödén, B', 'Sederholm, C', 'Wagenius, G']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2008.10.021
Randomized phase II study of weekly docetaxel plus trastuzumab versus weekly paclitaxel plus trastuzumab in patients with previously untreated advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the human epidermal growth factor receptor‐2 (HER‐2). Nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) overexpresses HER‐2 protein in approximately 20% of cases. In the current study, the authors combined trastuzumab with weekly taxanes in an attempt to improve outcomes over standard chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. METHODS: The primary objective was to determine whether docetaxel plus trastuzumab or paclitaxel plus trastuzumab was the superior regimen based on response and toxicity, and to determine whether either regimen was appropriate for further testing in a randomized Phase III trial. After stratification based on the results of HER‐2 immunohistochemistry, chemotherapy‐naive patients were randomized to receive trastuzumab plus docetaxel or trastuzumab plus paclitaxel. The study was designed so patients with or without HER‐2 overexpression would be distributed equally between the study arms. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry for HER‐2 protein expression was attempted for 182 pathologic samples from 169 patients. Twenty‐eight of the 179 evaluable samples (16%) revealed 2+ or 3+ staining. The objective response rate was 23% (7 of 30 patients) in the patients treated with docetaxel plus trastuzumab and 32% (11 of 34 patients) in the patients treated with paclitaxel plus trastuzumab (P=0.76, Wilcoxon test). No difference was noted in the median survival (16 mos vs. 14 mos) or 1‐year survival (57% vs. 55%) (P=0.998). Toxicities were mild in both treatment arms. No difference with regard to response rates or survival was noted between HER‐2‐positive (2+ or 3+) and HER‐2‐negative (0‐1+) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of HER‐2 protein in patients with advanced NSCLC in this study was found to be similar to that reported in previous series. The response rates and toxicities for patients treated with docetaxel and trasuzumab or paclitaxel and trasuzumab were not significantly different, though survival in both arms was better than expected. HER‐2 expression status did not appear to affect outcomes for this uniform group of patients who were treated in a comparable fashion. Because of the infrequency of HER‐2 overexpression, and the absence of improved outcomes in patients with NSCLC who were treated with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in other studies, neither regimen tested will be advanced to a Phase III trial.","['Krug, LM', 'Miller, VA', 'Patel, J', 'Crapanzano, J', 'Azzoli, CG', 'Gomez, J', 'Kris, MG', 'Heelan, RT', 'Pizzo, B', 'Tyson, L', 'et al.']",10.1002/cncr.21428
Crizotinib versus Chemotherapy in Asian Patients with ALK-Positive Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer,"Purpose: Crizotinib has demonstrated superior progression‐free survival (PFS) and objective response rates (ORRs) versus chemotherapy in previously treated and untreated patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)‐positive advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report the safety and efficacy of crizotinib in Asian subpopulations of two global phase III trials. Materials and Methods: This analysis evaluated previously treated and untreated patients in two randomized, openlabel phase III trials of crizotinib versus chemotherapy in ALK‐positive advanced NSCLC in second‐line (PROFILE 1007) and first‐line settings (PROFILE 1014). Efficacy and safety were analyzed by race in the intention‐to‐treat and ""as‐treated"" populations for efficacy and safety endpoints, respectively. Results: In previously treated (n=157) and untreated (n=157) Asian patients, PFS was statistically significantly longer with crizotinib versus chemotherapy (hazard ratio for PFS, 0.526; 95% confidence interval, 0.363 to 0.762; p < 0.001 and hazard ratio, 0.442; 95% confidence interval, 0.302 to 0.648; p < 0.001, respectively). Similar antitumor activity was seen in the non‐Asian and overall populations. ORRs were statistically significantly higher with crizotinib versus chemotherapy in both Asian and non‐Asian previously treated and untreated patients (p < 0.05). The most common treatment‐emergent adverse events (any grade)with crizotinib were vision disorder, diarrhea, and nausea, which were observed at a comparable incidence across Asian and non‐Asian populations, irrespective of previous treatment status. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. Conclusion: These data, currently the only analysis showing Asian and non‐Asian populations in the same study, support the efficacy and safety of crizotinib in Asian patients with previously treated or untreated ALK‐positive advanced NSCLC.","['Nishio, M', 'Kim, DW', 'Wu, YL', 'Nakagawa, K', 'Solomon, BJ', 'Shaw, AT', 'Hashigaki, S', 'Ohki, E', 'Usari, T', 'Paolini, J', 'et al.']",10.4143/crt.2017.280
Responses of lung cancer survivors undergoing gamma knife surgery to supportive group psychotherapy,"An increasingly important concern for clinicians who care for patients with cancers is their psychological problems and quality of life. The present study examined the efficacy of supportive group psychotherapy (SGP) on anxiety, depression and overall quality of life in patients with lung cancer undergoing gamma knife surgery (GKS).160 patients with lung cancer undergoing GKS were randomly divided into SGP group (n = 82) and care as usual (CAU) group (n = 78). Patients in SGP group received 90 minutes' group psychotherapy intervention once a week for 8 weeks, while patients in CAU group received usual care. Outcome measures were administered before and after the intervention and at 3‐months follow‐up. The primary outcome measures were the 14‐item Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the secondary outcome measures were the 30‐item European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire‐Core 30 (EORTC QLQ‐C30).Demographic characteristics between SGP and CAU groups showed no difference in sex, age, course of disease, years of education, marital status and profession. Psychological characteristics evaluated by HADS revealed that levels of both depression and anxiety in SGP group were significantly improved compared with that in CAU group at the end of the treatment and the improvement remained at the 3‐months follow‐up. In addition, EORTC QLQ‐C30 demonstrated that functional scales including emotion, cognition and society in SGP group were significantly higher than that in CAU group at the end of the treatment and maintained till 3‐months follow‐up. EORTC QLQ‐C30 also showed that symptom scales including fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, syspnea, insomnia, loss of appetite and financial problems in the former group were significantly lower than that in the latter group and maintained till 3‐months follow‐up. Furthermore, compared with that in SGP group before treatment, these variables in both HADS and EORTC QLQ‐C30 showed obvious improvement in the same group after treatment and at the 3‐months follow‐up.The results suggested that SGP can alleviate anxiety and depression in patients with lung cancer following GKS and improve the overall quality of life.","['Peng, W', 'Zhang, H', 'Li, Z']",10.1097/MD.0000000000014693
Survival determinants in extensive-stage non-small-cell lung cancer: the Southwest Oncology Group experience,"We analyzed the 2,531‐patient Southwest Oncology Group extensive‐stage non‐small‐cell lung cancer (ENSCLC) data base from 1974 to 1988 to (1) assess the interactions of host‐ or tumor‐related prognostic factors and therapy using Cox modeling and recursive partitioning and amalgamation (RPA) to determine whether each independently predicts outcome, and (2) use RPA to define prognostic subsets with different survival potentials. Good performance status (PS), female sex, and age greater than or equal to 70 years were significant independent predictors in a Cox model applied to the entire population. In a second Cox model for patients with good PS enrolled on recent studies, hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11.0 g/dL, normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), normal calcium, and a single metastatic site were significant favorable factors. The use of cisplatin was an additional independent predictor of improved outcome in both Cox models after adjustments for year of accrual and all prognostic variables. The favorable effect of cisplatin was observed in each of six RPA‐derived subgroups from the entire population. A second RPA of 904 patients from recent trials (nearly all received cisplatin‐based therapy) resulted in three distinct prognostic subsets based on PS, age, hemoglobin, and LDH; greater than or equal to 1‐year survivals were 27%, 16%, and 6% (P less than .0001). The best survival occurred for patients with a good PS who had a hemoglobin level greater than or equal to 11 g/dL and who were older than 47 years. This analysis suggests that although several factors were independent variables in the Cox models, three important prognostic subgroups were easily defined through RPA. Together with other analyses, our results suggest the need to modify the stage IV category in NSCLC.","['Albain, KS', 'Crowley, JJ', 'LeBlanc, M', 'Livingston, RB']",10.1200/JCO.1991.9.9.1618
The Effects of the Respiratory Rehabilitation Program on Perceived Self-Efficacy and Dyspnea in Patients with Lung Cancer,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the effects of the respiratory rehabilitation program on perceived self‐efficacy and dyspnea in patients with lung cancer. Methods: This is a quasi‐experimental research study with a two‐group repeated measures design with the pretest and post‐test at Week 4 and Week 8. The theory of self‐efficacy by Bandura was used as the conceptual framework. The sample consisted of patients with non–small‐cell lung cancer Stage 4 who visited the oncology clinic in a university hospital. Twenty‐eight patients were enrolled and equally allocated to the control group and experimental group. The control group received routine nursing care only, whereas the experimental group received the respiratory rehabilitation program. The program comprised dyspnea educating, breathing exercise, using handheld fans, effective coughing, respiratory strengthening training, and follow‐up by phone in the third and sixth week. Data for perceived self‐efficacy and dyspnea were collected before the program start and reassessment in the fourth and eighth week. Instrumentation was composed of the respiratory rehabilitation program, demographic data, perceived self‐efficacy assessment for respiratory rehabilitation, and the Cancer Dyspnea Scale. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and one‐factor repeated measures analysis of variance and by comparing means between groups. Results: The result revealed that almost all of the patients in the sample were men, and the mean age of the experimental group and control group was 65.80 years (standard deviation = 8.80) and 73.00 years (standard deviation = 7.60), respectively. There was significant different in the mean score of perceived self‐efficacy and dyspnea between the experimental group and the control group (p < .050). Conclusion: Based on the findings of the study, the respiratory rehabilitation program should be used to promote self‐efficacy and relieve dyspnea in patients with lung cancer.","['Saetan, P', 'Chaiviboontham, S', 'Pokpalagon, P', 'Chansriwong, P']",10.1016/j.anr.2020.08.010
Participation in community-based lung cancer screening: the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial,"BACKGROUND: Screening with low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer mortality; however, the most effective strategy for optimising participation is unknown. Here we present data from the Yorkshire Lung Screening Trial, including response to invitation, screening eligibility and uptake of community‐based LDCT screening. METHODS: Individuals aged 55‐80 years, identified from primary care records as having ever smoked, were randomised prior to consent to invitation to telephone lung cancer risk assessment or usual care. The invitation strategy included general practitioner endorsement, pre‐invitation and two reminder invitations. After telephone triage, those at higher risk were invited to a Lung Health Check (LHC) with immediate access to a mobile CT scanner. RESULTS: Of 44 943 individuals invited, 50.8% (n=22 815) responded and underwent telephone‐based risk assessment (16.7% and 7.3% following first and second reminders, respectively). A lower response rate was associated with current smoking status (adjusted OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.42‐0.46) and socioeconomic deprivation (adjusted OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.54‐0.62 for the most versus the least deprived quintile). Of those responding, 34.4% (n=7853) were potentially eligible for screening and offered a LHC, of whom 86.8% (n=6819) attended. Lower uptake was associated with current smoking status (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62‐0.87) and socioeconomic deprivation (adjusted OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62‐0.98). In total, 6650 individuals had a baseline LDCT scan, representing 99.7% of eligible LHC attendees. CONCLUSIONS: Telephone risk assessment followed by a community‐based LHC is an effective strategy for lung cancer screening implementation. However, lower participation associated with current smoking status and socioeconomic deprivation underlines the importance of research to ensure equitable access to screening.","['Crosbie, PAJ', 'Gabe, R', 'Simmonds, I', 'Hancock, N', 'Alexandris, P', 'Kennedy, M', 'Rogerson, S', 'Baldwin, D', 'Booton, R', 'Bradley, C', 'et al.']",10.1183/13993003.00483-2022
PAlliative RAdioTherapy to Lung Cancer A Randomized Multicentre Phase III Study,"1. Background 1.1 Radiotherapy in lung cancer Non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer‐related death in both men and women [1]. In stage IV disease platinum‐based chemotherapy yields a median overall survival (OS) of 8‐10 months [2]. When diagnosed, more than 50% of the patients have distant metastases. Forty percent have signs or symptoms originating from the thorax: dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, recurrent pneumonia or chest pain [3]. Palliative thoracic radiotherapy can relieve symptoms originating from intra‐thoracic malignancy and improves quality of life (QoL) in approximately one third of patients [4]. It is increasingly used in daily clinical practice as an alternative to chemotherapy in patients without local symptoms with the purpose of prolonging life and avoiding local thoracic symptoms. In addition, palliative radiotherapy is used to relieve symptoms before initiating systemic treatment (chemotherapy, targeted agents, immune therapy, etc). In this latter case, it is important not to delay the systemic treatment unnecessary with long schedules of radiotherapy. An optimal radiotherapy regimen will thus palliate symptoms with minimal toxicity and consider the patient's time investment, as well as be compatible with any additional treatments given. In a recent retrospective study of 159 consecutive Danish NSCLC patients who received palliative thoracic radiotherapy (2010‐11) median survival was 4.2 months. One third of the patients died within two months and 22% within 30 days [5]. This further underlines the importance of not subjecting patients to prolonged, toxic treatments in their final year of life. A recent Cochrane review [6] found that there was no consistent evidence to support that longer, more fractionated radiotherapy regimens gave better or more durable palliation than shorter regimens. Furthermore, there was no significant survival advantage associated with longer regimens with higher biological radiation doses. The most common acute toxicity is oesophagitis. It is often not technically possible to avoid high dose exposure to the oesophagus because of the target localization in proximity to the mediastinum. Radiation‐induced oesophagitis is most often a reversible condition. However, it compromises swallowing due to pain, causes weight loss and deterioration of the performance state (PS) and QoL at a vulnerable time for the patient, and it may impact the possibility of receiving further anti‐neoplastic treatment. The Cochrane review found that up to 50% of patients receiving palliative thoracic radiotherapy reported severe oesophagitis. The studies differed widely in terms of physician‐ or patient self‐assessment, timing, and the method used, and no overall judgement could be made. The review concluded that toxicity was comparable between different radiotherapy regimens. However, recording and reporting of early toxicity was lacking in the included studies. This absence of early toxicity data means that the current evidence is insufficient for clinical decision making in this patient group. 4. Treatment verification and quality assurance 4.1 Verification of treatment position Daily imaging must be performed and used for daily correction of treatment position. 7. Complications All complication (side effects) will be evaluated according to the NCI‐CTCAE v 5.0 during all followup visits. 2. Study design The patients will be invited to participate in the study prior to initiation of palliative radiotherapy. After signing informed consent the patients will be randomized 1:1 between two different radiotherapy dose fractionations: 30 Gy/10 F or 20 Gy/4 F. Physicians and patients will not be blinded to the randomization. 2.1 Systemic therapy Patients can receive chemotherapy, immunotherapy and targeted therapy during radiotherapy. 2.2 Study sample size and time frame According to the Danish Lung Cancer Registry, 50% of the 4700 lung cancer patients diagnosed yearly are in advanced stage. Of these, one third is supposed to benefit from palliative thoracic radiotherapy and of these, 400 patients ( 50%) are expected to be enrolled on the trial each year. Since 1184 consecutive patients are required (see chapter 7) the study is expected to enrol patients over a 3‐year period. Given the declared support of all Danish radiotherapy centres, this is considered a realistic time frame. Following study closure, 3 weeks of follow‐up after radiotherapy initiation will be allowed for all patients, at which point data will be collected for primary analysis. Further analysis will be performed 1 and 3 years after the last patient is enrolled. Data will be kept in databases 15 years after the last patient is included. 3. Radiotherapy treatment planning 3.1 Target and organs at risk The gross tumour volume (GTV) is defined by the referring oncologist based on a planning CT scan, and if available, a diagnostic PET/CT scan. The oncologist will note in the CRF if the GTV fully or only partially encompass all active malignant disease in the thorax. The clinical target volume (CTV) is identical to the GTV, and thus not delineated. Spinal cord or spinal canal, total lung, heart and the oesophagus are delineated for all patients based on the guidelines in [5,6]. The heart is cranially limited defined by the division of truncus pulmonalis. The oesophagus is delineated from cartilago criocoideum to the gastro‐oesophageal junction. 3.2 Dose planning Patients are treated with conformal treatment plans, conventional or intensity‐modulated. 8.

Participants Patients with lung cancer stage III‐IV not suitable for curative treatment, being referred for palliative radiotherapy either alone or in addition to systemic treatment. 5.1 Evaluations during treatment and follow up 5.1.1 Expected side effects Palliative RT comes with a risk of side‐effects including fatigue, pain and soreness in the throat and chest, reddening of the skin in the irradiated area and dry cough and dyspnoea. 5.1.2 Scoring of symptoms and QoL Symptom scores on oesophagitis, cough, pain, dyspnoea, bronchopulmonary haemorrhage, performance status and QoL will be registered at baseline, end of treatment, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 8‐10 weeks and 6 months after radiotherapy completion. If the patient has symptoms which need clinical assessment, the patient will get an appointment with a physician. All complication (side effects) will be evaluated according to the NCI‐CTCAE v 5.0 during all follow‐up visits or calls [7]. See appendix C for an overview of the CTCAE v 5.0. Table 6.1 shows the evaluation plan for the trial. Symptom scores on oesophagitis, cough, pain, dyspnoea, bronchopulmonary haemorrhage, and assessment of performance status will be registered during the patient on‐site visit at baseline, end of treatment, 8‐10 weeks after treatment and 6 months after treatment completion. At 2 weeks and 3 weeks, symptom scores will be registered by a phone call. Questionnaires for registration of QoL will be filled in on‐site by the patient at baseline, end of treatment, 8‐10 weeks after completion of treatment and 6 months after completion of treatment. In addition, two questionnaires for registration of QoL to be filled in 2 weeks and 3 weeks after completion of treatment will be handed out at end of treatment. During the phone calls at 2 weeks and 3 weeks, the patient will be reminded to fill in the questionnaire. The questionnaires will be collected at the on‐site visit at 8‐10 weeks after treatment. One or both phonecalls at 2 weeks and 3 weeks may be substituted by on site visits. After the end of the study‐specified visit, patients will be seen every 3rd month according to the guidelines by the Danish Health Authorities. Evaluation of toxicity will be performed at every occasion. End of study is 3 years after commencement of radiotherapy. 5.2 Quality of Life To examine the participants' quality of life (QoL) during follow up, they will be asked to fill in a QoL questionnaire. The EuroQoL 5D (EQ‐5D‐5L) questionnaire will be used. 6. Statistical considerations and planned data analyses 6.1 Sample size calculation for primary endpoint ‐ acute oesophagitis The primary study endpoint is reduction in early oesophageal toxicity, as assessed two weeks after completion of radiotherapy. The investigators assume that 50% of patients who receive the standard treatment (30 Gy in 10 fractions) will experience grade 2 or worse oesophagitis, compared to their baseline prior to treatment. A reduction in acute toxicity of 10%‐point with the experimental treatment (odds ratio between arms of 0.67) will be clinically meaningful and will justify a change of practice for this patient group. This corresponds to an expected 40% rate of acute oesophagitis in the experimental arm. With 90% power and a 2‐sided type 1 error rate of 5%, 1184 patients will be required (assuming 1:1 allocations between treatment arms, and incorporating a 10% loss to follow‐up). There are some clinical indications that oesophageal‐related toxicity will mainly be seen in patients with centrally located tumours (where palliative radiotherapy results in irradiation of mediastinal structures). These patients make up approximately two thirds of the palliative radiotherapy patient population. An incidence of oesophagitis of 70% in these patients (and 10% in patients with peripheral tumours) is consistent with the observed overall toxicity rate. Enrolling 790 patients with central tumours in the study will result in >95% power to detect a 15%‐point reduction of toxicity in this subgroup, from 70% to 55% (consistent with an overall reduction of 10%, assuming very limited effect in patients with peripheral tumours). Alternatively, there will be nearly 80% power to detect a 10%‐point toxicity reduction in the central tumour subgroup. Any such subgroup analyses will be completely exploratory. All sample size and power calculations for the primary endpoint are based on two‐group chi‐squared tests (continuity corrected) of equal proportions. 6.2 Non‐inferiority of overall survival Current best evidence indicates that overall survival should not be different with shorter compared to longer palliative treatment regimens, although the literature is not conclusive. The proposed study will have the power to test for non‐inferiority of the short (experimental) treatment arm compared to the standard treatment: Assuming a median OS of 4.2 months, inclusion of 1184 patients over 3 years (with one year of additional follow‐up) will give approximately 90% power to test that median OS in the experimental arm is at most 3 weeks shorter than in the standard arm (one‐sided significance level of 95%). Power calculations for overall survival are based on Cox's proportional hazards model. 6.3 Planned data analyses All analyses will be conducted on an intention to treat (ITT) basis. The primary endpoint analysis will take place once all enrolled patients have reached the primary endpoint assessment (2 weeks after completion of radiotherapy). A multivariate logistic regression model will be used to compare rates of grade 2+ acute oesophagitis in the two treatment arms, adjusted for stratification factors. Robustness of the primary endpoint to the timing of oesophagitis assessment will be examined in secondary analyses, comparing the two arms with respect to oesophagitis rates at 3 weeks after end of therapy as well as oesophagitis rates at 4 weeks after the start of therapy (two weeks after end of therapy in the standard arm and three weeks after end of therapy in the experimental arm). Significance testing will be two‐sided, with a 95% significance level. Analysis of secondary endpoints will depend on the follow‐up required for each endpoint; with most endpoints (QoL, response assessment) available at the time of primary analysis, and initial analysis of overall survival conducted one year after randomisation of the final patient. 6.4 Randomization ‐ Patients are stratified prior to randomization by treatment institution, performance status 0/1 versus 2, and histology (small cell carcinoma vs squamos cell carcinoma vs non‐squamos cell carcinoma). ‐ Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the two different radiotherapy dose fractionations",['NCT03632603'],
"1194TiP AdvanTIG-205: phase II trial of ociperlimab (OCI) + tislelizumab (TIS) + chemotherapy (chemo) in first line (1L) treatment of patients (pts) with locally advanced (LA), unresectable, or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC)","Background: T‐cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based inhibitory motif domains (TIGIT) is a co‐inhibitory immune checkpoint receptor upregulated on T cells and natural killer cells in multiple solid tumors. Early phase clinical trials have shown antitumor activity of anti‐TIGIT monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) + anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) mAbs in pts with mNSCLC. OCI is a humanized mAb designed to bind to Fc‐intact TIGIT with high affinity and specificity. In China, TIS, an anti‐PD‐1 mAb, is approved for 2/3L treatment of LA/mNSCLC, and 1L treatment of NSCLC with chemo. AdvanTIG‐205 is a Phase 2 study (NCT05014815) designed to assess the efficacy and safety of OCI + TIS + chemo in 1L treatment of pts with LA, unresectable or mNSCLC. Trial design: Approximately 270 pts with histologically/cytologically confirmed squamous (sq) or non‐squamous (non‐sq) NSCLC, with no prior systemic therapy for advanced disease, and in whom driver mutation‐directed therapy is not indicated, will be enrolled. Eligible pts will be randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous (IV) OCI 900 mg or placebo, with TIS 200 mg IV + chemo every 3 weeks (Q3W) for 4–6 cycles during the induction phase. For pts with sq NSCLC, chemo includes carboplatin (area under the concentration‐time curve [AUC] 5 or 6, day [D] 1) + paclitaxel (P; 175 mg/m2 or 200 mg/m2, D1) or nab‐P (100 mg/m2, D1, D8 and D15) Q3W. For pts with non‐sq NSCLC, chemo includes cisplatin (75 mg/m2, D1) or carboplatin (AUC 5, D1) + pemetrexed (500 mg/m2, D1) Q3W. For maintenance, pts will receive OCI or placebo, with TIS (+ pemetrexed for pts with non‐sq NSCLC). Treatment will continue until intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, or absence of benefit. Primary endpoint is progression‐free survival in the intent‐to‐treat analysis set (per investigator [INV]; RECIST v1.1). Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, duration of response (both per INV; RECIST v1.1), overall survival, and safety. Exploratory endpoints include disease control rate, biomarker status and health related quality of life. This study is recruiting. Prof. B. Zhu and Prof. T. M.

Patient navigation for lung cancer screening in an urban safety-net system: protocol for a pragmatic randomized clinical trial,"The National Lung Screening Trial demonstrated improved lung cancer mortality with annual low‐dose computed tomography (CT) screening, leading to lung cancer screening endorsement by the United States Preventive Services Task Force and coverage by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Adherence to annual CT screens in that trial was 95%, which may not be representative of real‐world, particularly medically underserved populations. This pragmatic trial will determine the effect of patient‐focused, telephone‐based patient navigation on adherence to CT‐based lung cancer screening in an urban safety‐net population. 340 adults who meet standard eligibility for lung cancer screening (age 55‐77years, smoking history≥30 pack‐years, quit within 15years if former smoker) are referred through an electronic medical record‐based order by physicians in community‐ and hospital‐based primary care settings within the Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas County, Texas. Eligible patients are randomized to usual care or patient navigation, which addresses adherence, patient‐reported barriers, smoking cessation, and psycho‐social concerns related to screening completion. Patients complete surveys and semi‐structured interviews at baseline, 6‐month, and 18‐month follow‐ups to assess attitudes toward screening. The primary endpoint of this pragmatic trial is adherence to three sequential, prospectively defined steps in the screening protocol. Secondary endpoints include self‐reported tobacco use and other patient‐reported outcomes. Results will provide real‐world insight into the impact of patient navigation on adherence to CT‐based lung cancer screening in a medically underserved population. This study was registered with the NIH ClinicalTrials.gov database (NCT02758054) on April 26, 2016.","['Gerber, DE', 'Hamann, HA', 'Santini, NO', 'Abbara, S', 'Chiu, H', 'McGuire, M', 'Quirk, L', 'Zhu, H', 'Lee, SJC']",10.1016/j.cct.2017.07.003
Influence of xlaoliu baofei pill combined with chemotherapy on quality of life of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To objectively assess the influence of Xiaoliu Baofei Pill (XBP) combined with chemotherapy on quality of life (QOL) of patients with stage III‐IV non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Forty NSCLC patients were equally randomized into 2 groups, the treated group treated with XBP plus chemotherapy, and the control group treated with chemotherapy alone. Patients' QOL was assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT‐L) before and after treatment. RESULTS: The scores of the physical condition in the treated group was relatively stable while it lowered significantly as time went by in the control group, significant difference was shown as compared with before treatment and with that in the treated group at the same time points (P < 0.05); scores of the mood condition, the function conditions and additional concerned condition were improved gradually from the 3rd collection in the treated group, but decreased in the control group, although some improvement of mood and function conditions had revealed temporarily in the early stage of treatment. Comparison between groups showed significant difference (P < 0.05). Besides, no significant change was found in domains of patient‐doctor relation and society/family condition in both groups. CONCLUSION: XBP combined with chemotherapy can obviously improve the QOL of advanced NSCLC patients.","['Sun, HX', 'Qin, J', 'Zhou, YQ']",
Influence of wellness education on first-line icotinib hydrochloride patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer and their family caregivers,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the effects of wellness education (WE) intervention on the behavioral change, psychological status, performance status on patients with stage IV non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing icotinib hydrochloride treatment and their relationships with family caregivers. METHODS: We conducted an intervention study involving 126 individuals with confirmed activating epidermal growth factor receptor mutation‐positive stage IV NSCLC who received icotinib hydrochloride as first‐line therapy between January 2014 and January 2016; their caregivers were also included in the study. For a period of 12 weeks, participants were randomly assigned into WE and control groups. The patients and family members in the WE group were provided with WE information about treatment, diet, social needs, rehabilitation, physical/mental health education, communication strategies, and patient care advice at least 3 times per week during treatment. Qualitative feedback of the participants was recorded during the intervention. Food Composition Database, the Family Environment Scale, patients/caregivers quality‐of‐life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Lung/Caregiver Quality of Life Index‐Cancer Scale), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were measured at baseline and for 12 weeks. Data were analyzed to compare the different outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 126 caregivers (64 WE and 62 control), 120 completed the study. We observed significant differences between the WE group and control group with respect to low daily calorie intake (31.0% vs 77.4%, p < 0.05), smoking cessationaaa and awareness of cancer (85.48% vs 100%, p < 0.05). The WE group showed high ratings on awareness of cancer risk and benefit, as well as confidence relating to the behaviors of healthful diet and self‐motivation to conduct cancer test. Family caregivers had high ratings on 30‐minute daily moderate physical activity (p > 0.05). After 12 weeks, WE intervention had improved scores on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy‐Lung‐EWB and Caregiver Quality of Life Index‐Cancer Scale adaptation. In addition, the patients also showed improvements in HADS. CONCLUSION: WE interventions in patients with stage IV NSCLC undergoing icotinib hydrochloride treatment and their family resulted in strong intentions to engage in health‐promoting behaviors related to physical activity, smoking cessationaaa, and nutrition at the treatment period. WE intervention is a viable way to improve quality of life and HADS. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Findings from this study suggest that WE interventions in patients' family with stage IV NSCLC undergoing icotinib hydrochloride treatment are significant improvements in both HADS and quality of life. These data also indicate that lung cancer disparities are unlikely to be associated with differential willingness to receive care but that Chinese may perceive financial and insurance ebarriers to treatment.","['Yanwei, L', 'Minghui, F', 'Manman, Q', 'Zhuchun, Y', 'Dongying, L', 'Zhanyu, P']",10.1016/j.currproblcancer.2018.03.006
Randomized controlled trial of S-1 versus docetaxel in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (East Asia S-1 Trial in Lung Cancer),"Background: Chemotherapy remains a viable option for the management of advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) despite recent advances in molecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy. We evaluated the efficacy of oral 5‐fluorouracil‐based S‐1 as second‐ or third‐line therapy compared with standard docetaxel therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients and methods: Patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with ≥1 platinum‐based therapy were randomized 1 : 1 to docetaxel (60 mg/m2 in Japan, 75 mg/m2 at all other study sites; day 1 in a 3‐week cycle) or S‐1 (80‐120 mg/day, depending on body surface area; days 1‐28 in a 6‐week cycle). The primary endpoint was overall survival. The non‐inferiority margin was a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.2. Results: A total of 1154 patients (577 in each arm) were enrolled, with balanced patient characteristics between the two arms. Median overall survival was 12.75 and 12.52 months in the S‐1 and docetaxel arms, respectively [HR 0.945; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.833‐1.073; P = 0.3818]. The upper limit of 95% CI of HR fell below 1.2, confirming non‐inferiority of S‐1 to docetaxel. Difference in progression‐free survival between treatments was not significant (HR 1.033; 95% CI 0.913‐1.168; P = 0.6080). Response rate was 8.3% and 9.9% in the S‐1 and docetaxel arms, respectively. Significant improvement was observed in the EORTC QLQ‐C30 global health status over time points in the S‐1 arm. The most common adverse drug reactions were decreased appetite (50.4%), nausea (36.4%), and diarrhea (35.9%) in the S‐1 arm, and neutropenia (54.8%), leukocytopenia (43.9%), and alopecia (46.6%) in the docetaxel arm. Conclusion: S‐1 is equally as efficacious as docetaxel and offers a treatment option for patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC.

Radiotherapy in the management of locally advanced lung cancer of all cell types: final report of randomized trial,"Between 1975 and 1978, 343 evaluable male patients with a diagnosis of locally advanced lung cancer of all cell types were entered in Protocol 15. The patients had unresectable or inoperable tumor limited to one hemithorax and no evidence of distant metastases. The cell‐type distribution was as follows: squamous cell carcinoma (Sq CC) 137 (40%); positive cytology 66 (19%); large cell carcinoma 57 (17%); small cell carcinoma (SCC) 46 (13%) and adenocarcinoma 37 (11%). An intermediate course of irradiation (ICI) of 5000 rads in 25 fractions, 200 rads each, in 5 weeks was compared with a short course of irradiation (SCI) of 4200 rads in 15 fractions, 280 rads each, in 3 weeks (equal Nominal Standard Dose). The effectiveness of low dose irradiation to control subclinical brain metastases was studied and was reported separately. The median survival for all 343 patients was 38 weeks. There was no significant difference in survival, response and control rate between the 191 ICI and the 152 SCI patients. The following factors had a significant individual influence on survival: initial performance status, ambulatory vs. nonambulatory, P = 0.006; histology, Sq CC vs. other cell types (OCT), P = 0.0007; prior surgery, less than 6 weeks vs. greater than 6 weeks, p = 0.04; tumor size, diameter less than 6 cm vs. greater than 6 cm, P = 0.05 and weight loss less than 5% vs. greater than 5% in the previous 6 months, P = 0.01. The overall response rate (CR or PR) was 38%. The median duration of response was shorter for the ICI group when compared with the SCI group, 18.4 vs. 34.4 weeks, P = 0.02. The presence of partial or complete response enhanced the median survival 50 vs. 31 weeks. Cell type, Sq CC vs. OCT was an important factor for the duration of response, 49 vs. 21 weeks, P = 0.0006. The complication rate was similar for the 191 ICI patients when compared with the 152 SCI patients. There were however, two patients with radiation myelopathy among the SCI patients and none among the ICI patients.","['Petrovich, Z', 'Stanley, K', 'Cox, JD', 'Paig, C']",10.1002/1097-0142(19810915)48:6<1335::aid-cncr2820480614>3.0.co;2-s
Meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials comparing cisplatin to carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: It remains undetermined whether cisplatin and carboplatin are equally effective for advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We therefore did a meta‐analysis of trials that compared cisplatin‐based chemotherapy with carboplatin‐based chemotherapy. METHODS: We performed a literature search to identify trials that had investigated the substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin in the treatment of advanced NSCLC. We evaluated these trials for inclusion, rated methodologic quality, and abstracted relevant data. RESULTS: Of 1,191 reports, eight trials (2,948 patients) were identified, five of which investigated drug regimens containing platinum plus a new agent. Cisplatin‐based chemotherapy produced a higher response rate, but the survival advantage was not significant (hazard ratio = 1.050; 95% CI, 0.907 to 1.216; P =.515). Subgroup analysis revealed that combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin plus a new agent yields 11% longer survival than carboplatin plus the same new agent (hazard ratio = 1.106; 95% CI, 1.005 to 1.218; P =.039). Patients on cisplatin‐based chemotherapy frequently developed nausea and vomiting; thrombocytopenia was more frequent during carboplatin‐based chemotherapy. No significant difference in treatment‐related mortality was observed. CONCLUSION: We found that combination chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin plus a new agent yields a substantial survival advantage compared with carboplatin plus a new agent in patients with advanced NSCLC, although we failed to find any survival difference in an analysis that included both new and old agents. The strength of our conclusion is limited because we used abstracted data, and careful interpretation is thus required. Nevertheless, our results raise a critical point that needs to be evaluated in future studies.","['Hotta, K', 'Matsuo, K', 'Ueoka, H', 'Kiura, K', 'Tabata, M', 'Tanimoto, M']",10.1200/JCO.2004.02.109
Vinorelbine and gemcitabine vs vinorelbine and carboplatin as first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. A phase III randomised controlled trial by the Norwegian Lung Cancer Study Group,"BACKGROUND: Platinum‐based doublet chemotherapy is the standard first‐line treatment for advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but earlier studies have suggested that non‐platinum combinations are equally effective and better tolerated. We conducted a national, randomised study to compare a non‐platinum with a platinum combination. METHODS: Eligible patients had stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and performance status (PS) 0‐2. Patients received up to three cycles of vinorelbine 60 mg m(‐2) p.o.+gemcitabine 1000 mg m(‐2) i.v. day 1 and 8 (VG) or vinorelbine 60 mg m(‐2) p.o. day 1 and 8+carboplatin area under the curve=5 (Calvert's formula) i.v. day 1 (VC). Patients ≥75 years received 75% of the dose. Endpoints were overall survival, health‐related quality of life (HRQoL), toxicity, and the use of radiotherapy. RESULTS: We randomised 444 patients from September 2007 to April 2009. The median age was 65 years, 58% were men and 25% had PS 2. Median survival was VG: 6.3 months; VC: 7.0 months, P=0.802. Vinorelbine plus carboplatin patients had more grade III/IV nausea/vomiting (VG: 4%, VC: 12%, P=0.008) and grade IV neutropenia (VG: 7%, VC: 19%, P<0.001). Infections, HRQoL and the use of radiotherapy did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. CONCLUSION: The two regimens yielded similar overall survival. The VG combination had only a slightly better toxicity profile.","['Fløtten, Ø', 'Grønberg, BH', 'Bremnes, R', 'Amundsen, T', 'Sundstrøm, S', 'Rolke, H', 'Hornslien, K', 'Wentzel-Larsen, T', 'Aasebø, U', 'von Plessen, C']",10.1038/bjc.2012.284
Racial Differences in the Influence of Health Care System Factors on Informal Support for Cancer Care Among Black and White Breast and Lung Cancer Survivors,"This retrospective, secondary qualitative analysis investigates whether health system factors influence social support among Black and white breast and lung cancer survivors and racial differences in support. These data come from race‐ and cancer‐stratified focus groups (n = 6) and interviews (n = 2) to inform a randomized controlled trial utilizing antiracism and community‐based participatory research approaches. Findings indicate social support was helpful for overcoming treatment‐related challenges, including symptom management and patient‐provider communication; racial differences in support needs and provision were noted. Resources within individual support networks reflect broader sociostructural factors. Reliance on family/friends to fill gaps in cancer care may exacerbate racial disparities.","['Ellis, KR', 'Black, KZ', 'Baker, S', 'Cothern, C', 'Davis, K', 'Doost, K', 'Goestch, C', 'Griesemer, I', 'Guerrab, F', 'Lightfoot, AF', 'et al.']",10.1097/FCH.0000000000000264
Effect of Postoperative Radiotherapy for Patients With pIIIA-N2 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer After Complete Resection and Adjuvant Chemotherapy: the Phase 3 PORT-C Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: The role of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) has not been well defined in resected pIIIA‐N2 non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Objective: To evaluate the effect of PORT using modern techniques on survival and safety in patients with pIIIA‐N2 NSCLC after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: The PORT‐C randomized clinical trial was conducted in 394 patients with pIIIA‐N2 NSCLC treated with complete resection and 4 cycles of platinum‐based chemotherapy between January 2009 and December 2017. Data were analyzed between March 2019 and December 2020. Interventions: Patients were randomized equally into the PORT arm (n = 202) or the observation arm (n = 192). The total dose of PORT was 50 Gy. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary end point was disease‐free survival (DFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), locoregional recurrence‐free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis‐free survival, and toxic effects. Results: In total, 394 patients were enrolled and 364 were eligible, with a median (range) age of 55 (25‐70) years. There were 202 (55.5%) male and 162 (44.5%) female patients. The median follow‐up was 46.0 (95% CI, 41.9‐51.4) months, and 230 DFS events were reported. There were 184 patients in the PORT arm and 180 patients in the observation arm. The 3‐year DFS rates were 40.5% with PORT vs 32.7% with observation (median, 22.1 vs 18.6 months), and the difference in DFS was not statistically significant without adjustment (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65‐1.09; P =.20), though it was significant with preplanned yet exploratory analysis (stratified analysis by the number of detected lymph nodes and positive lymph nodes, HR, 0.75; log‐rank P =.04). The 3‐year OS rates were 78.3% vs 82.8% (HR, 1.02; P =.93), and LRFS was 66.5% vs 59.7% (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.51‐0.97; P =.03), respectively. For 310 per‐protocol patients (140 with PORT and 170 with observation), PORT significantly improved DFS (42.8% vs 30.6%; HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.57‐1.00; P =.05) but not OS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.53‐1.30; P =.41). The 3‐year local recurrence only rates were 9.5% and 18.3% in the 2 arms, respectively (Fine‐Gray HR, 0.55; Gray test P =.04). No radiotherapy‐related grade 4 or 5 adverse event was observed. Conclusions and Relevance: In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial of patients with pIIIA‐N2 NSCLC after complete resection and adjuvant chemotherapy, PORT did not improve DFS. Further studies exploring patients who might best benefit from PORT are needed.

"Superiority of alternating non-cross-resistant chemotherapy in extensive small cell lung cancer. A multicenter, randomized clinical trial by the National Cancer Institute of Canada","The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group conducted a prospective randomized study comparing standard chemotherapy with alternating chemotherapy in patients with extensive small cell lung cancer. ""Standard"" treatment consisted of cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m2 body surface area); doxorubicin (50 mg/m2), and vincristine (2 mg) every 3 weeks for six courses. Alternating chemotherapy was cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine alternating with etoposide (100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) and cisplatin (25 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3) every 3 weeks for six treatment cycles. Two hundred eighty‐nine patients were eligible and evaluable for response to therapy and survival. Best response was higher in patients on alternating chemotherapy (complete plus partial response, 80% compared with 63.2%; p less than 0.002). Progression‐free survival for patients on alternating chemotherapy was superior (p less than 0.0001) as was overall survival (p = 0.03). Major toxicities were equally frequent in both treatment groups. These results show a modest superiority of alternating chemotherapy over standard therapy in extensive small cell lung cancer.","['Evans, WK', 'Feld, R', 'Murray, N', 'Willan, A', 'Coy, P', 'Osoba, D', 'Shepherd, FA', 'Clark, DA', 'Levitt, M', 'MacDonald, A']",10.7326/0003-4819-107-4-451
Phase III study of cisplatin with pemtrexed or vinorelbine plus concurrent late course accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer,"Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cisplatin with pemtrexed or vinorelbine and concurrent late course accelerated hyperfractionated radiotherapy (LCAHRT). Patients with unresectable stage III non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned to two regimens. The experimental (PP) arm included cisplatin, pemtrexed and concurrent LCAHRT based on bilateral lung V20 = 33%. The control (NP) arm used cisplatin, vinorelbine with the same radiotherapy protocol. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Median survival times were 26.0 months (95% CI 23.2 to 28.7 months) and 28.5 months (95% CI 17.1 to 39.9 months) for the NP and PP arms, respectively (P = 0.26). Median progression‐free survival was 12.5 months and 17.5 months in the NP and PP arms (P = 0.07). In both arms of the study, there were no differences in overall survival between patients with squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC. The incidences of grade 3 or 4 toxicity were higher in NP than PP arm. With concurrent LCAHRT, pemetrexed/cisplatin was equally as efficacious as vinorelbine/cisplatin, but showed a more favorable toxicity profile.","['Zhao, Q', 'Wang, Z', 'Huang, W', 'Wang, Q', 'Yu, S', 'Zhou, T', 'Han, D', 'Wu, Z', 'Gong, H', 'Sun, H', 'et al.']",10.18632/oncotarget.6871
A randomized study of oral nutritional support versus ad lib nutritional intake during chemotherapy for advanced colorectal and non-small-cell lung cancer,"One hundred ninety‐two patients with previously untreated metastatic cancer (102 non‐small‐cell lung cancer [NSCLC]; 90 colorectal cancer) were randomized to receive either ad lib nutritional intake (control group) or specific nutritional intervention during a 12‐week study period when chemotherapy was administered. Those patients randomized to nutritional interventions were counselled to take oral nutrients with caloric intake equal to 1.7 to 1.95 times their basal energy expenditure, depending on their pretreatment nutritional status (""standard"" group). An augmented group was counselled to have a caloric intake equivalent to that of the standard group but with 25% of calories provided as protein and additional supplements of zinc and magnesium. Counselling increased caloric intake in both tumor types but reduced weight loss in the short term only for lung cancer patients. Ninety‐three NSCLC patients were evaluable for tumor response to vindesine and cisplatin. Overall, only 20.4% of the patients responded, and there were no significant differences in response rates, median time to progression, or overall duration of survival between the nutrition intervention groups and the control group. The tumor response rate to time‐sequenced 5‐fluorouracil (5‐FU) and methotrexate in the 81 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer was only 14.8%, and no significant differences in tumor response rates were noted between the three groups. Furthermore, the median time to progression and overall duration of survival were not different for the control, standard, and augmented groups. Nutritional interventions using dietary counselling had no impact on the percent of planned chemotherapy dose administered, the degree of toxicity experienced by patients, or the frequency of treatment delays. A multivariate prognostic factor analysis demonstrated that for lung cancer, the percent of weight loss, serum albumin concentration, and presence of liver metastases were significant (P less than .05) and independent prognostic variables for survival duration. For colorectal cancer, serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, and percent targeted caloric intake (TCI) were significant independent predictors of survival duration.","['Evans, WK', 'Nixon, DW', 'Daly, JM', 'Ellenberg, SS', 'Gardner, L', 'Wolfe, E', 'Shepherd, FA', 'Feld, R', 'Gralla, R', 'Fine, S']",10.1200/JCO.1987.5.1.113
Randomized phase II study of carboplatin/paclitaxel followed by gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine followed by docetaxel in patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the chemotherapeutic regimens suitable for the outpatient settings, we conducted a randomized phase II study of carboplatin/paclitaxel followed by gemcitabine versus carboplatin/gemcitabine followed by docetaxel. METHODS: Group CP(n=25): carboplatin AUC 6.0 day 1 and paclitaxel 70 mg/m2 day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks followed by gemcitabine 1.0 g/m2 day 1, 8, 15 every 4 weeks; group CG(n=26): carboplatin AUC 2.0 and gemcitabine 0.8 g/m2 day 1, 8 every 3 weeks followed by docetaxel 60 mg/m2 day 1, 8 every 3 weeks. RESULTS: The response rate of the first line therapy was 18.0% in group CP and 21.7% in group CG and that of the second line therapy was 10.0% and 14.3%, respectively. Time to progression of the first line therapy was 4.0 months in group CP and 4.3 months in group CG, that of the second line therapy was 2.1 months and 2.8 months, respectively. The median survival time was 10.9 months in group CP and 10.3 months in group CG. No statistically significant differences were documented in the response rate, time to progression, and overall survival between these two groups. Severe hematologic toxicity was rare in both groups and no symptomatic peripheral neuropathy was documented in carboplatin/paclitaxel therapy. CONCLUSION: Carboplatin /paclitaxel followed by gemcitabine and carboplatin/gemcitabine followed by docetaxel were well tolerated and equal in efficacy. Both regimens in this study seemed to be suitable for the outpatient settings because of their mild hematologic toxicity and peripheral neuropathy.","['Furuiye, M', 'Ishiwata, N', 'Jin, Y', 'Miyashita, Y', 'Takano, S', 'Yoshizawa, M', 'Miyake, S', 'Inase, N', 'Yoshizawa, Y']",
Phase I study of Paclitaxel given by seven-week continuous infusion concurrent with radiation therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel is active in non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is a radiosensitizer with a dose‐response relationship that depends more on duration of exposure than peak concentration. A continuous infusion prolongs exposure and may maximize the drug‐radiation interaction. The goal of this National Cancer Institute‐sponsored phase I study was to determine the feasibility and toxicity of a continuous infusion paclitaxel (24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 7 weeks total) concurrent with standard radiation therapy (RT) for locally advanced NSCLC. METHODS: Eligible patients had locally advanced (T4, N1‐3, M0 or Tany, N2‐3, M0) NSCLC, performance status less than or equal to 2, and adequate hematological, hepatic, renal, and pulmonary function. RT was given to a total dose of 64.8 Gy at 1.8 Gy/day. Paclitaxel was delivered by infusion beginning 48 hours before and then continuously throughout the 7 weeks of RT. The paclitaxel concentration was escalated in sequential dose cohorts ranging from 0.5 to 17 mg/m/d, and each contained at least three patients in a standard phase I design. RESULTS: Twenty‐nine patients were enrolled. Significant grade 3+ toxicity was observed in one patient, who experienced grade 3 pneumonitis at the 6.5‐mg/m/day dose level. This cohort was expanded, but none of four additional patients experienced significant toxicity. Three patients completed the 15‐mg/m/day dose level without serious or dose‐limiting toxicity. The two patients entered at the 17‐mg/m/day dose level had grade 4 neutropenia requiring a delay in therapy of more than 1 week. The median survival of all patients was 12 months; however, 4 of 27 patients (15%) survived longer than 60 months (mean 63.4 months). CONCLUSION: The maximally tolerated and recommended phase II paclitaxel dose delivered by protracted continuous infusion is 15 mg/m/day when combined with thoracic RT. This schedule allows for the delivery of more total paclitaxel than other published regimens and may have less esophagitis than weekly paclitaxel regimens. This regimen has the potential to achieve a radiosensitizing serum concentration of paclitaxel continuously for 7 weeks without exceeding levels associated with neutropenia or neurotoxicity. There were four long‐term survivors in this phase I study. These data suggest that continuous paclitaxel infusion with concurrent RT is safe and should be of interest to explore in combination with other cytotoxic or targeted therapies.","['Rosenthal, DI', 'Fuller, CD', 'Machtay, M', 'Algazy, KM', 'Meyer, DM', 'Kaiser, LR', 'Yardley, DA', 'Loiacano, ME', 'Carbone, DP']",
Randomized phase III study of chemoradiation with or without amifostine for patients with favorable performance status inoperable stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer: preliminary results,"A prospective randomized study was conducted to determine whether amifostine (Ethyol) reduces the rate of severe esophagitis and hematologic and pulmonary toxicity associated with chemoradiation or improves control of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Sixty patients with inoperable stage II or III NSCLC were treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Both groups received thoracic radiation therapy (TRT) with 1.2 Gy/fraction, 2 fraction per day, 5 days per week for a total dose 69.6 Gy. All patients received oral etoposide (VP‐16), 50 mg Bid, 30 minutes before TRT beginning day 1 for 10 days, repeated on day 29, and cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, 29, and 36. Patients in the study group received amifostine, 500 mg intravenously, twice weekly before chemoradiation (arm 1); patients in the control group received chemoradiation without amifostine (arm 2). Patient and tumor characteristics were distributed equally in both groups. Of the 60 patients enrolled, 53 were evaluable (27 in arm 1, 26 in arm 2) with a median follow‐up of 6 months. Median survival times were 26 months for arm 1 and 15 months for arm 2, not statistically significantly different. Morphine intake to reduce severe esophagitis was significantly lower in arm 1 (2 of 27, 7.4%) than arm 2 (8 of 26, 31%; P =.03). Acute pneumonitis was significantly lower in arm 1 (1 of 27, 3.7%) than in arm 2 (6 of 26, 23%; P =.037). Hypotension (20 mm Hg decrease from baseline blood pressure) was significantly more frequent in arm 1 (19 of 27, 70%) than arm 2 (1 of 26, 3.8%; P =.0001). Only 1 patient discontinued treatment because of hypotension. These preliminary results showed that amifostine significantly reduced acute severe esophagitis and pneumonitis. Further observation is required to assess long‐term efficacy.","['Komaki, R', 'Lee, JS', 'Kaplan, B', 'Allen, P', 'Kelly, JF', 'Liao, Z', 'Stevens, CW', 'Fossella, FV', 'Zinner, R', 'Papadimitrakopoulou, V', 'et al.']",10.1053/srao.2002.31363
"Dacomitinib versus gefitinib as first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial","BACKGROUND: Dacomitinib is a second‐generation, irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We compared its efficacy and safety with that of the reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in the first‐line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR‐mutation‐positive non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: In this international, multicentre, randomised, open‐label, phase 3 study (ARCHER 1050), we enrolled adults (aged ≥18 years or ≥20 years in Japan and South Korea) with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC and one EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) at 71 academic medical centres and university hospitals in seven countries or special administrative regions. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to receive oral dacomitinib 45 mg/day (in 28‐day cycles) or oral gefitinib 250 mg/day (in 28‐day cycles) until disease progression or another discontinuation criterion was met. Randomisation, stratified by race and EGFR mutation type, was done with a computer‐generated random code assigned by a central interactive web response system. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival assessed by masked independent review in the intention‐to‐treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01774721, and is ongoing but no longer recruiting patients. FINDINGS: Between May 9, 2013, and March 20, 2015, 452 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive dacomitinib (n=227) or gefitinib (n=225). Median duration of follow‐up for progression‐free survival was 22·1 months (95% CI 20·3‐23·9). Median progression‐free survival according to masked independent review was 14·7 months (95% CI 11·1‐16·6) in the dacomitinib group and 9·2 months (9·1‐11·0) in the gefitinib group (hazard ratio 0·59, 95% CI 0·47‐0·74; p<0·0001). The most common grade 3‐4 adverse events were dermatitis acneiform (31 [14%] of 227 patients given dacomitinib vs none of 224 patients given gefitinib), diarrhoea (19 [8%] vs two [1%]), and raised alanine aminotransferase levels (two [1%] vs 19 [8%]). Treatment‐related serious adverse events were reported in 21 (9%) patients given dacomitinib and in ten (4%) patients given gefitinib. Two treatment‐related deaths occurred in the dacomitinib group (one related to untreated diarrhoea and one to untreated cholelithases/liver disease) and one in the gefitinib group (related to sigmoid colon diverticulitis/rupture complicated by pneumonia). INTERPRETATION: Dacomitinib significantly improved progression‐free survival over gefitinib in first‐line treatment of patients with EGFR‐mutation‐positive NSCLC and should be considered as a new treatment option for this population.

Efficacy study of single-agent gemcitabine versus gemcitabine plus carboplatin in untreated elderly patients with stage IIIb/IV non-small-cell lung cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To explore a chemotherapeutic regimen suitable for non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in elderly patients. METHODS: A total of 68 elderly patients with NSCLC (stage IIIb/IV) were equally and randomly divided into single‐agent and combined groups. Patients in single‐agent group received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) at Days 1 and 8 for a 21‐day cycle. Those in combined group received gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) at Days 1 and 8 in combination carboplatin AUC5 at Day 2 for a 21‐day cycle. The drugs were intravenously administered. All patients received 3 cycles of treatment. RESULTS: In single‐agent and combined groups, CR 1 and 1, PR 12 and 13, response rates 38% and 41% were respectively observed. There was no statistically significant difference between two groups (P > 0.05). The 1‐year and 2‐year survival rates of single‐agent and combined groups were 31% vs 32% and 12% vs 14% with a median survival of 9.9 and 9.8 months without a statistically significant difference (P > 0.05). The rates of leucopenia and thrombocytopenia (III‐IV degree) were 47% and 38% in combined group and they were higher than 24% and 15% in single‐agent group with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). The observer scale of lung cancer symptom scale showed that the post‐treatment scores of appetite, fatigue and pain significantly improved in single‐agent group while no improvement was observed in combined group. Also the scores of appetite, fatigue and pain of single‐agent group were higher than those of combined group after chemotherapy (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Single‐agent gemcitabine regimen is more suitable for advanced NSCLC in elderly patients.","['Lou, GY', 'Li, T', 'Gu, CP', 'Hong, D', 'Zhang, YP']",
Clinical assessment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer eligible for second-line chemotherapy: a prognostic score from individual data of nine randomised trials,"PURPOSE: Knowledge of prognostic factors for advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients eligible for second‐line treatment is scarce. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic role of a number of routinely collected clinical variables and to provide a summary index to discriminate patients according to probability of survival. METHODS: Individual data from nine randomised trials of second‐line treatment in advanced NSCLC were analysed. Primary end‐point was overall survival (OS). Cox model, stratified by trial, was used for multivariate analyses, and a prognostic index was provided and validated according to an internal/external procedure. RESULTS: Out of 1239 patients, 1197 patients (97%) had complete information. Median OS was 7.4months. At multivariate analysis, prognosis was significantly influenced by gender (worse in males), performance status (PS), tumour histology (worse in squamous and other histology versus adenocarcinoma), stage (worse in IV versus IIIB), type of previous treatment (worse for patients pretreated with platinum) and response to first‐line (worse for patients not obtaining objective response). Prognostic score values range from 0 to 14. When three categories were derived, median overall survival values were equal to 11.6, 7.5 and 3.0months for best (<5), intermediate (5‐9) and worst (>9) categories, respectively. CONCLUSION: Prognosis of patients eligible for second‐line treatment of advanced NSCLC is significantly conditioned by gender, PS, histology, stage, previous use of platinum and response to first‐line. A prognostic score was derived that discriminates well subjects with a relatively more favourable prognosis and those with very short life expectancy.","['Di Maio, M', 'Lama, N', 'Morabito, A', 'Smit, EF', 'Georgoulias, V', 'Takeda, K', 'Quoix, E', 'Hatzidaki, D', 'Wachters, FM', 'Gebbia, V', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.ejca.2009.12.013
Phase III study of immediate compared with delayed docetaxel after front-line therapy with gemcitabine plus carboplatin in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: Gemcitabine plus carboplatin (GC) is active as front‐line treatment for advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For patients without progression, timing of second‐line chemotherapy for optimum clinical benefit remains uncertain. This phase III, randomized trial assessed the efficacy and safety of docetaxel administered either immediately after GC or at disease progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The chemotherapy‐naïve patients enrolled had either stage IIIB NSCLC with pleural effusion or stage IV NSCLC. Gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) was administered on days 1 and 8 followed by carboplatin (area under the curve = 5) on day 1. After four 21‐day cycles, patients who did not have progression were randomly assigned either to an immediate docetaxel group (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 21 days, with maximum of six cycles) or to a delayed docetaxel group. The primary end point was overall survival (OS) measured from random assignment. Additional analyses included tumor response, toxicity, progression‐free survival (PFS), and quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: Enrollment totaled 566 patients; 398 patients completed GC; 309 patients were randomly assigned equally to the two docetaxel treatment groups. Toxicity profiles were generally comparable for the docetaxel groups. Median PFS for immediate docetaxel (5.7 months) was significantly greater (P = .0001) than for delayed docetaxel (2.7 months). Median OS for immediate docetaxel (12.3 months) was greater than for delayed docetaxel (9.7 months), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = .0853). QOL results were not statistically different (P = .76) between docetaxel groups. CONCLUSION: We observed a statistically significant improvement in PFS and a nonstatistically significant increase in OS when docetaxel was administered immediately after front‐line GC, without increasing toxicity or decreasing QOL.","['Fidias, PM', 'Dakhil, SR', 'Lyss, AP', 'Loesch, DM', 'Waterhouse, DM', 'Bromund, JL', 'Chen, R', 'Hristova-Kazmierski, M', 'Treat, J', 'Obasaju, CK', 'et al.']",10.1200/JCO.2008.17.1405
"Efficacy and safety of maintenance erlotinib in Asian patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: a subanalysis of the phase III, randomized SATURN study","Maintenance therapy, commenced immediately after the completion of first‐line chemotherapy, is a promising strategy for improving treatment outcomes in patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The global phase III SequentiAl Tarceva in UnResectable NSCLC (SATURN) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine‐kinase inhibitor erlotinib as maintenance treatment in NSCLC patients without progression after first‐line chemotherapy. We report a retrospective subanalysis of Asian patients enrolled in SATURN. Patients with advanced NSCLC with no evidence of progression after four cycles of chemotherapy were randomized to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day or placebo, until progressive disease or limiting toxicity. The co‐primary endpoints of SATURN were progression‐free survival (PFS) in all patients and in those with positive EGFR immunohistochemistry (IHC) status. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), disease control rate, safety, quality of life (QoL) and biomarker analyses. In total, 126 patients from East and South‐East Asian centers were randomized (14% of the intent‐to‐treat population): 88 from Korea, 28 from China and 10 from Malaysia; one patient was excluded from this analysis due to Indian ethnicity. PFS was significantly prolonged in the erlotinib treatment arm, both overall (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.57; p=0.0067) and in patients with EGFR IHC‐positive disease (HR=0.50; p=0.0057). There was a trend towards an increase in OS, which reached statistical significance in the EGFR IHC‐positive subgroup (p=0.0233). The overall response rate was significantly higher with erlotinib compared with placebo (24% versus 5%; p=0.0025). Erlotinib was generally well tolerated and had no negative impact on QoL in this subpopulation. The most common treatment‐related adverse events were rash, diarrhea and pruritus. Erlotinib was effective and well tolerated in Asian patients, producing benefits consistent with those observed in the overall SATURN population. Maintenance treatment with erlotinib appears to be a useful option for the management of Asian patients with advanced NSCLC without progression after first‐line chemotherapy.","['Wu, YL', 'Kim, JH', 'Park, K', 'Zaatar, A', 'Klingelschmitt, G', 'Ng, C']",10.1016/j.lungcan.2012.03.012
Randomized phase II study of daily versus continuous-infusion schedules of topotecan in the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancers,"A randomized two‐stage, phase II study was conducted to assess the antitumor activity of two different schedules of topotecan in the treatment of extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (SCLC) in chemotherapy‐naive patients. A total of 40 eligible patients were randomized to receive either the daily schedule, with topotecan being administered intravenously at 1.5 mg/m2 daily for 5 days every 3 weeks, or the continuous‐infusion schedule, with topotecan administered intravenously at a dosage of 1.3 mg/m2 per day over 72 hours every 4 weeks. Randomization to the continuous‐infusion schedule was discontinued due to inactivity, and an additional 20 patients were treated on the daily schedule. Patients received an average of 5 courses (range: 1‐13) of the daily schedule compared to an average of 2 courses (range: 1‐7) of the continuous‐infusion schedule (p < 0.01). Confirmed response rates for the daily and continuous‐infusion schedules are 62.5% (90% CI: 49‐75%) and 15% (90% CI: 1‐29%), respectively. Toxicity was predominantly hematologic with 92% (55/60) having greater than or equal to grade III neutropenia and 58% (35/60) reporting greater than or equal to grade III leukopenia for both IV schedules. Nonhematologic toxicity was very mild, with only 10% (6/60) patients experiencing grade IV toxicities. One patient died of infection on the continuous‐infusion arm. Median times to progression for the daily and continuous‐infusion schedules are 5 months (90% CI: 4.4‐7.2) and 2 months (90% CI: 1.1‐2.1), respectively. Estimated 1‐year survival rates for patients receiving daily and continuous‐infusion schedules are 63% (90% CI: 51‐76%) and 55% (90% CI: 39‐77%), respectively. Fifty percent (30/60) of patients received second‐line therapy with etoposide and cisplatin. Forty‐three percent (13/30) of patients who received second‐line therapy achieved a confirmed response.

Comparative effectiveness of bevacizumab plus cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus pemetrexed plus cisplatin treatment in East Asian non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients applying real-life outcomes,"AIM: To indirectly compare real‐life clinical effectiveness of bevacizumab + cisplatin‐based therapy from the Safety of Avastin in Lung (SAiL) phase IV clinical trial with published evidence from the phase III clinical trial for pemetrexed + cisplatin among East Asian patients with non‐squamous metastatic or recurrent non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Survival outcomes were compared between subgroups of East Asian patients receiving treatments of either bevacizumab + cisplatin‐based chemotherapy or pemetrexed + cisplatin using a matching‐adjusted indirect comparison approach. Patient‐level data were used to derive a new group with similar characteristics compared to those reported in a phase III clinical trial evaluating pemetrexed + cisplatin therapy. Exclusions to the SAiL data included those with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 2, those with mixed cell histology, non‐East Asians and those who did not receive cisplatin‐based chemotherapy. In total 1000 samples of the pre‐matched analysis set of the SAiL data were selected that resulted in equal distributions of the ECOG PS and gender matching variables selected and evaluated for a progression‐free survival (PFS) outcome. RESULTS: Median PFS was longer for patients treated with bevacizumab‐based therapy (7.4 months; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.7‐8.2) versus pemetrexed + cisplatin (6.4 months; 95% CI N/A) among non‐squamous East Asian NSCLC patients. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that East Asian non‐squamous NSCLC patients treated with bevacizumab‐based therapy have a trend toward improved PFS outcomes compared to those treated with pemetrexed + cisplatin, even after adjusting for differences between the two trial groups.","['Chang, GC', 'Ahn, MJ', 'Wright, E', 'Kim, HT', 'Kim, JH', 'Kang, JH', 'Kim, SW', 'Sherman, S', 'Walzer, S']",10.1111/j.1743-7563.2011.01400.x
Efficacy and safety of lorlatinib in Asian and non-Asian patients with ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer: subgroup analysis of a global phase 2 trial,"Objectives: To analyze the efficacy and safety of lorlatinib in Asian and non‐Asian patients with pretreated anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)‐positive, advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from a phase 1/2 study. Materials and methods: In this ongoing phase 2 part of the trial, patients with ALK‐ or ROS1‐positive, advanced NSCLC enrolled into six expansion cohorts (EXP1–6), based on ALK and ROS1 status and previous therapy, and received lorlatinib 100 mg once daily. The primary endpoint was objective tumor response and intracranial response. Post hoc analyses of activity were conducted in Asian and non‐Asian (based on race) ALK‐positive patients who received either previous crizotinib with or without chemotherapy (EXP2–3A) or at least one second‐generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor with any number of chemotherapy regimens (EXP3B–5). Analysis of safety (adverse events [AEs]) was in the phase 1 and 2 study population who started lorlatinib 100 mg once daily. Results: 17 Asian patients were enrolled in EXP2–3A and 53 in EXP3B–5; 33 non‐Asian patients were enrolled in EXP2–3A and 73 in EXP3B–5. Objective response rates in the Asian and non‐Asian subgroups were 82.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 56.6–96.2) and 63.6% (95% CI: 45.1–79.6) in EXP2–3A, and 47.2% (95% CI: 33.3–61.4) and 30.1% (95% CI: 19.9–42.0) in EXP3B–5, and median progression‐free survival was 13.6 and 12.5 months (EXP2–3A) and 6.9 and 5.5 months (EXP3B–5). Lorlatinib exhibited antitumor activity across ALK resistance mutations, while no differences according to the EML4‐ALK variant could be detected. The most common treatment‐related AEs were hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, edema, and peripheral neuropathy in both Asian and non‐Asian subgroups. Conclusion: Lorlatinib showed substantial overall and intracranial activity in pretreated patients with ALK‐positive NSCLC in both Asian and non‐Asian patients. AE profiles were similar between Asian and non‐Asian patients.

Phase III study comparing chemotherapy and radiotherapy with preoperative chemotherapy and surgical resection in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer with spread to mediastinal lymph nodes (N2); final report of RTOG 89-01. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group,"PURPOSE: To compare the outcome of treatment of mediastinoscopy‐verified N2 non‐small‐cell lung cancer treated with induction chemotherapy followed by either surgery or radiotherapy (RT), with both options followed by consolidation chemotherapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A randomized Phase III trial for Stage IIIA (T1‐T3N2M0) non‐small cell lung cancer was conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group between April 1990 and April 1994. After documentation of N2 disease by mediastinoscopy or anterior mediastinotomy, patients received induction chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and mitomycin‐C. Mitomycin‐C was later dropped from the induction regimen. Patients were then randomized to surgery or RT (64 Gy in 7 weeks) followed by cisplatin and vinblastine. RESULTS: RTOG 89‐01 accrued 75 patients, of whom 73 were eligible and analyzable. Twelve patients received induction chemotherapy but were not randomized to RT or surgery thereafter. Forty‐five patients were randomized to postinduction RT or surgery. Of the analyzable patients, 90% had a Karnofsky performance score of 90‐100, 18% had weight loss >5%, 37% had squamous cell histologic features, and 54% had bulky N2 disease. The distribution of bulky N2 disease was uniform among the treatment arms. The incidence of Grade 4 toxicity was 56% in patients receiving mitomycin‐C and 29% in those who did not. Only 1 patient in each group had acute nonhematologic toxicity greater than Grade 3 (nausea and vomiting). No acute Grade 4 radiation toxicity developed. The incidences of long‐term toxicity were equivalent across the arms. Three treatment‐related deaths occurred: 2 patients in the surgical arms (one late pulmonary toxicity and one pulmonary embolus), and 1 patient in the radiation arm (radiation pneumonitis). Induction chemotherapy was completed in 78% of the patients. Complete resection was performed in 73% of 26 patients undergoing thoracotomy. Consolidation chemotherapy was completed in 75% of the patients. No statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms. The overall progression‐free survival rate was 53% at 1 year and 17% at 3 years. The median progression‐free survival was 14 months. No difference in the 1‐year survival rate (70% vs. 66%) or median survival time (19.4 vs. 17.4 months) between the surgery and RT arms. The median survival in the patients receiving induction chemotherapy only was 8.9 months. Mitomycin‐C had no impact on survival (p = 0.75). No statistically significant difference was noted in the time to local failure between the surgical and RT arms. CONCLUSION: The patient accrual to this trial made its results inconclusive, but several observations are notable. In this trial, histologic confirmation of N2 disease in the surgical and nonsurgical arms eliminated the usual biases from clinical staging. In this setting, local control and survival were essentially equal between the surgical and RT arms. The 3‐ and 5‐year survival rates of nonsurgical therapy were comparable to published surgical trials of N2 disease.","['Johnstone, DW', 'Byhardt, RW', 'Ettinger, D', 'Scott, CB']",10.1016/s0360-3016(02)02943-7
"Age, Race, and Income are Associated with Lower Screening Rates at a Safety Net Hospital","BACKGROUND: While lung cancer screening improves cancer‐specific mortality and is recommended for high‐risk patients, barriers to screening still exist. We sought to determine our institution's (an urban safety net hospital) screening rate and to identify socioeconomic barriers to lung cancer screening. METHODS: We identified 8935 smokers 55 to 80 years of age evaluated by a primary care physician between March 2015 and March 2017 at our institution. We randomly selected one‐third of these (n = 2978) to review for eligibility using the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force criteria for lung cancer screening. Using our institution's Lung Cancer Screening Program clinical tracking database, we identified patients who were screened from March 2015 to March 2017. We collected demographic information (race, primary language, education status, and median income) and evaluated possible associations with screening. RESULTS: Among our institution population, 99 patients meeting U.S. Preventive Services Task Force screening criteria underwent screening computed tomography, whereas 516 eligible patients were not screened, making our institution's estimated screening rate 16.1%. Comparing the unscreened population with those who received screening at our institution, the unscreened population was significantly older (median age of screened patients was 63 years, of unscreened patients was 66 years; P < .001). African Americans had a lower screening rate (37.6% of the screened population and 47.5% of the unscreened population; P < .001). Unscreened patients had a lower annual household income. CONCLUSIONS: The lung cancer screening rate at our hospital is 16.1%. Unscreened patients were older, were more likely to be African American, and had a lower median income. These findings highlight possible screening barriers and potential areas for targeted strategies to decrease disparities in lung cancer screening.","['Steiling, K', 'Loui, T', 'Asokan, S', 'Nims, S', 'Moreira, P', 'Rebello, A', 'Litle, VR', 'Suzuki, K']",10.1016/j.athoracsur.2019.11.052
Phase III study comparing second- and third-generation regimens with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: west Japan Thoracic Oncology Group WJTOG0105,"PURPOSE: This phase III trial of concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) was conducted to compare third‐generation chemotherapy with second‐generation chemotherapy in patients with unresectable stage III non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients received the following treatments: A (control), four cycles of mitomycin (8 mg/m(2) on day 1)/vindesine (3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8)/cisplatin (80 mg/m(2) on day 1) plus TRT 60 Gy (treatment break for 1 week); B, weekly irinotecan (20 mg/m(2))/carboplatin (area under the plasma concentration‐time curve [AUC] 2) for 6 weeks plus TRT 60 Gy, followed by two courses of irinotecan (50 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8)/carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1); C, weekly paclitaxel (40 mg/m(2))/carboplatin (AUC 2) for 6 weeks plus TRT 60 Gy, followed by two courses of paclitaxel (200 mg/m(2) on day 1)/carboplatin (AUC 5 on day 1). RESULTS: The median survival time and 5‐year survival rates were 20.5, 19.8, and 22.0 months and 17.5%, 17.8%, and 19.8% in arms A, B, and C, respectively. Although no significant differences in overall survival were apparent among the treatment arms, noninferiority of the experimental arms was not achieved. The incidences of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and gastrointestinal disorder were significantly higher in arm A than in arm B or C (P < .001). Chemotherapy interruptions were more common in arm B than in arm A or C. CONCLUSION: Arm C was equally efficacious and exhibited a more favorable toxicity profile among three arms. Arm C should be considered a standard regimen in the management of locally advanced unresectable NSCLC.","['Yamamoto, N', 'Nakagawa, K', 'Nishimura, Y', 'Tsujino, K', 'Satouchi, M', 'Kudo, S', 'Hida, T', 'Kawahara, M', 'Takeda, K', 'Katakami, N', 'et al.']",10.1200/JCO.2009.24.5050
"TG4010 immunotherapy and first-line chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (TIME): results from the phase 2b part of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b/3 trial","BACKGROUND: MUC1 is a tumour‐associated antigen expressed by many solid tumours, including non‐small‐cell lung cancer. TG4010 is a modified vaccinia Ankara expressing MUC1 and interleukin 2. In a previous study, TG4010 combined with chemotherapy showed activity in non‐small‐cell lung cancer and the baseline value of CD16, CD56, CD69 triple‐positive activated lymphocytes (TrPAL) was shown to be potentially predictive of TG4010 efficacy. In this phase 2b part of the phase 2b/3 TIME trial, we further assess TG4010 in combination with first‐line chemotherapy and use of the TrPAL biomarker in this setting. METHODS: In this phase 2b part of a randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, phase 2b/3 trial, we recruited previously untreated patients aged 18 years or older with stage IV non‐small‐cell lung cancer without a known activating EGFR mutation and with MUC1 expression in at least 50% of tumoural cells. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) by an external service provider to subcutaneous injections of 10(8) plaque‐forming units of TG4010 or placebo from the beginning of chemotherapy every week for 6 weeks and then every 3 weeks up to progression, discontinuation for any reason, or toxic effects, stratified according to baseline value of TrPAL (≤ or > the upper limit of normal [ULN]) and, in addition, a dynamic minimisation procedure was used, taking into account chemotherapy regimen, histology, addition or not of bevacizumab, performance status, and centre. Patients, site staff, monitors, the study funder, data managers, and the statistician were masked to treatment identity. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival, assessed every 6 weeks, to validate the predictive value of the TrPAL biomarker. If patients with TrPAL values of less than or equal to the ULN had a Bayesian probability of more than 95% that the true hazard ratio (HR) for progression‐free survival was less than 1, and if those with TrPAL values of greater than the ULN had a probability of more than 80% that the true HR for progression‐free survival was more than 1, the TrPAL biomarker would be validated. We did primary analyses in the intention‐to‐treat population and safety analyses in those who had received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one valid post‐baseline safety assessment. Monitors, site staff, and patients are still masked to treatment assignment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01383148. INTERPRETATION: TG4010 plus chemotherapy seems to improve progression‐free survival relative to placebo plus chemotherapy. These data support the clinical value of the TrPAL biomarker in this clinical setting; because the primary endpoint was met, the trial is to continue into the phase 3 part. FUNDING: Transgene, Avancées Diagnostiques pour de Nouvelles Approches Thérapeutiques (ADNA), and OSEO. FINDINGS: Between April 10, 2012, and Sept 12, 2014, we randomly allocated 222 patients (TG4010 and chemotherapy 111 [50%]; placebo and chemotherapy 111 [50%]). In the whole population, median progression‐free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 5·4‐6·7) in the TG4010 group and 5·1 months (4·2‐5·9) in the placebo group (HR 0·74 [95% CI 0·55‐0·98]; one‐sided p=0·019). In patients with TrPAL values of less than or equal to the ULN, the HR for progression‐free survival was 0·75 (0·54‐1·03); the posterior probability of the HR being less than 1 was 98·4%, and thus the primary endpoint was met. In patients with TrPAL values of greater than the ULN, the HR for progression‐free survival was 0·77 (0·42‐1·40); the posterior probability of the HR being greater than 1 was 31·3%, and the primary endpoint was not met. We noted grade 1‐2 injection‐site reactions in 36 (33%) of 110 patients in the TG4010 group versus four (4%) of 107 patients in the placebo group. We noted no grade 3 or 4 nor serious adverse events deemed to be related to TG4010 only. Four (4%) patients presented grade 3 or 4 adverse events related to TG4010 and other study treatments (chemotherapy or bevacizumab) versus 11 (10%) in the placebo group. No serious adverse event was related to the combination of TG4010 with other study treatments. The most frequent severe adverse events were neutropenia (grade 3 29 [26%], grade 4 13 [12%] in the TG4010 group vs grade 3 22 [21%], grade 4 11 [10%] in the placebo group), anaemia (grade 3 12 [11%] vs grade 3 16 [15%]), and fatigue (grade 3 12 [11%], grade 5 one [1%] vs grade 3 13 [12%]; no grade 4 events).","['Quoix, E', 'Lena, H', 'Losonczy, G', 'Forget, F', 'Chouaid, C', 'Papai, Z', 'Gervais, R', 'Ottensmeier, C', 'Szczesna, A', 'Kazarnowicz, A', 'et al.']",10.1016/S1470-2045(15)00483-0
Safety and immunogenicity of MAGE-A3 cancer immunotherapeutic with or without adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with resected stage IB to III MAGE-A3-positive non-small-cell lung cancer,"INTRODUCTION: To assess the safety and immunogenicity of MAGE‐A3 immunotherapeutic in patients with stage IB‐III MAGE‐A3‐positive non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who were or were not undergoing standard cisplatin/vinorelbine chemotherapy. METHODS: This open, prospective, multicenter, parallel‐group phase I study (NCT00455572) enrolled patients with resected (cohorts 1‐3) or unresectable (cohort 4) MAGE‐A3‐positive NSCLC. MAGE‐A3 immunotherapeutic (300 μg recombinant MAGE‐A3 formulated with AS15) was administered (eight doses, 3 weeks apart) concurrent with (cohort 1), after (cohort 2), or without (cohort 3) standard‐adjuvant chemotherapy, or after standard radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy (cohort 4). RESULTS: Sixty‐seven patients received greater than or equal to 1 dose of MAGE‐A3 immunotherapeutic. Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were reported for 16 out of 19 (84%), 2 out of 18 (11%), 5 out of 18 (28%), and 1 out of 12 (8%) patients in cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Many grade 3/4 AEs in cohort 1 (e.g., neutropenia) were typical of chemotherapy. Six patients, including three in cohort 1, reported study treatment‐related grade 3/4 AEs (injection‐site reactions or musculoskeletal/back pain, which resolved within 5 days). One patient (in cohort 4) died, but this and the other serious adverse events were not study treatment related. MAGE‐A3‐specific antibody responses to immunotherapy were induced in all patients evaluated in all cohorts. MAGE‐A3‐specific CD4 T‐cell responses to immunotherapy were detected in 4 out of 11 (36%), 4 out of 15 (27%), 2 out of 8 (25%), and 5 out of 6 (83%) evaluated patients in cohorts 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively; and CD8 T‐cell responses were only detected in four patients. CONCLUSION: In resected and unresectable NSCLC patients and irrespective of whether standard chemotherapy was concurrent or not, MAGE‐A3 immunotherapeutic is well tolerated and induces MAGE‐A3‐specific immune responses.","['Pujol, JL', 'Vansteenkiste, JF', 'De Pas, TM', 'Atanackovic, D', 'Reck, M', 'Thomeer, M', 'Douillard, JY', 'Fasola, G', 'Potter, V', 'Taylor, P', 'et al.']",10.1097/JTO.0000000000000653
Induction cisplatin/vinblastine and irradiation vs. irradiation in unresectable squamous cell lung cancer: failure patterns by cell type in RTOG 88-08/ECOG 4588. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group,"PURPOSE: To analyze disease failure patterns by pretreatment characteristics and treatment groups in a prospective randomized trial. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients with medically inoperable Stage II, unresectable IIIA and IIIB nonsmall cell lung cancer with KPS > or =70 and weight loss < or =5% were randomized to one of three treatment groups: standard radiation therapy with 60 Gy at 2.0 Gy per day (STD RT), induction chemotherapy with cisplatin 100 mg/m2 days 1 and 29 with vinblastine 5 mg/m2 weekly for 5 weeks followed by 60 Gy at 2.0 Gy per day (CT + RT), or hyperfractionated radiation therapy with 69.6 Gy at 1.2 Gy b.i.d. (HFX RT). Of 490 patients enrolled, 458 were evaluable. Minimum and median periods of observation for this analysis were 4 years and 6 years, respectively. RESULTS: Pretreatment characteristics were equally distributed. Toxicities were previously reported. Median survival rates were 11.4, 13.6, and 12.3 months for STD RT, CT + RT, and HFX RT, respectively (log rank p = 0.05, Wilcoxon p = 0.04). Survivals were 20, 31, and 24% at 2 years, and 4, 11, and 9% at 4 years in the STD RT, CT + RT, and HFX RT groups, respectively. There were no differences in local tumor control rates among the treatments. Patterns of first failure showed less distant metastasis (DM) (other than brain) for CT + RT compared to the RT alone arms (p = 0.04). Within squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), DM (other than brain) rates were 43%, 16%, and 38% in SCC for STD RT, CT + RT, and HFX RT, respectively (p = 0.0015). Patients with peripheral/chest wall lesions were significantly more likely to fail first in the thorax when treated on STD RT compared to CT + RT and HFX RT (p = 0.009). Survival rates were similar among the treatment arms for patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Among patients with nonsquamous cell carcinoma, failure patterns did not differ by treatment group, but survival was significantly better in those who were treated by induction chemotherapy (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with squamous cell carcinoma treated on the CT + RT arm had a significant reduction of first DM other than brain, but there was difference in survival. Survival favored CT + RT in nonsquamous carcinoma despite similar failure patterns. Reasons for improved survival with CT + RT in NSCLC are not yet available.","['Komaki, R', 'Scott, CB', 'Sause, WT', 'Johnson, DH', 'Taylor, SG', 'Lee, JS', 'Emami, B', 'Byhardt, RW', 'Curran, WJ', 'Dar, AR', 'et al.']",10.1016/s0360-3016(97)00365-9
Weekly nab-Paclitaxel in Combination With Carboplatin as First-Line Therapy in Patients With Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: analysis of Safety and Efficacy in Patients With Diabetes,"PURPOSE: To examine outcomes in a phase 3 trial of nab‐paclitaxel plus carboplatin (nab‐P/C) versus solvent‐based paclitaxel plus carboplatin (sb‐P/C) in a subset of patients with advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and diabetes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC received nab‐P 100 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 or sb‐P 200 mg/m2 on day 1, both with C at an area under the curve of 6 mg·min/mL on day 1 every 3 weeks. Overall response rate (ORR) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were determined by blinded, independent, centralized review. P values were based on chi‐square test for ORR and log‐rank test for overall survival (OS) and PFS. RESULTS: Of the 1052 randomized patients in the phase 3 trial, 61 had diabetes according to prespecified terms (nab‐P/C, 31; sb‐P/C, 30). ORR for nab‐P/C versus sb‐P/C in this subset was 52% versus 27% (relative risk ratio, 1.935; P = .046), median PFS was 10.9 versus 4.9 months (hazard ratio, 0.420; P = .016), and median OS was 17.5 versus 11.1 months (hazard ratio, 0.550; P = .057). Treatment differences in PFS remained significant (P ≤ .036) after adjusting for histology, region, stage, race, and age and also remained significant in OS for histology (P = .039). Patients with diabetes experienced lower rates of grade 3 or higher neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy and higher rates of thrombocytopenia and anemia with nab‐P/C versus sb‐P/C. CONCLUSION: nab‐P/C demonstrated improved efficacy and manageable tolerability in patients with advanced NSCLC and diabetes.","['Hirsh, V', 'Ko, A', 'Pilot, R', 'Renschler, MF', 'Socinski, MA']",10.1016/j.cllc.2016.04.002
"QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL), TOLERABILITY, AND SUPPORTIVE CARE RESULTS: NECITUMUMAB PHASE 3 SQUIRE STUDY","Aim: Characterize QoL, tolerability, and supportive care of patients (pts) receiving necitumumab (N) + gemcitabine‐cisplatin (GC) in the SQUIRE study. Methods: Pts with ECOG performance status (PS) 0‐2, stage IV squamous NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to GC (G = 1250 mg/m2 IV days 1, 8; C = 75 mg/m2 IV day 1) + N (800 mg absolute dose IV), or GC alone (every 21 days up to 6 cycles). Pts treated with GC + N with no disease progression (PD) continued on N monotherapy until PD. Pt reported symptoms were measured by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) prior to the start of each cycle (1‐6) and every 6 weeks thereafter until PD. Physician reported PS was measured before every cycle. Tolerability was measured by number of cycles received, treatment discontinuation for adverse events (AEs), rates of serious AEs (SAEs), % of pts receiving N monotherapy post‐induction. AEs (Safety Common Terminology Criteria [v3.0]) and supportive care data were collected while pts were on study. Results: 1093 pts were randomized (545 GC + N Arm, 548 GC Arm); 7 pts in each arm were not treated. 88.3% (GC + N) and 88.0% (GC) pts had a baseline and ≥ 1 post‐baseline LCSS assessment. 95% CIs for the hazard ratios (HRs) for time to deterioration (TTD) of all 12 variables contained 1. The HR for TTD of PS by ≥1 point (cycles 1‐6) was 0.861 (95% CI: 0.692‐1.071). GC + N pts received a median of 6 cycles (interquartile [IQ] range 3‐6) of GC, and a median of 6 cycles (IQ range 3‐10) of N. GC pts received a median of 5 cycles (IQ range 3‐6). Treatment discontinuation rates due to AEs were 13.6% (GC + N) and 14.6% (GC). SAEs were 47.8% (GC + N) and 37.5% (GC). The most common grade ≥3 AE was neutropenia, 24.3% (GC + N) and 27.5% (GC). 51% of GC + N pts continued on N monotherapy (median: 4 additional cycles). Select supportive care for treated patients is summarized in Table below. Conclusions: Long‐term use of N was well tolerated. There were no major differences in AE rates, no detrimental effect overall of adding N to GC in terms of patients’ QoL (symptoms and PS). Supportive care and associated resource use were modest.

Racial Differences in Outcomes within the National Lung Screening Trial. Implications for Widespread Implementation,"Rationale: Black individuals with lung cancer (LC) experience higher mortality because they present with more advanced disease and are less likely to undergo curative resection for early‐stage disease. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated improved LC mortality by screening high‐risk patients with low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT). The benefit of LDCT screening in black individuals is unknown. Objectives: Examine results of the NLST by race. Methods: This was a secondary analysis of a randomized trial (NCT00047385) performed in 33 U.S. centers. Measurements and Main Results: Overall and lung cancer‐specific mortality were measured. Screening with LDCT reduced LC mortality in all racial groups but more so in black individuals (hazard ratio [HR], 0.61 vs. 0.86). Smoking increased the likelihood of death from LC, and when stratified by race black smokers were twice as likely to die as white smokers (HR, 4.10 vs. 2.25). Adjusting for sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, black individuals experienced higher all‐cause mortality than white individuals (HR, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.22‐1.49); however, black individuals screened with LDCT had a reduction in all‐cause mortality. Black individuals were younger, were more likely to be current smokers, had more comorbidities, and had fewer years of formal education than white individuals (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Black individuals screened with LDCT had decreased mortality from lung cancer. However, the demographics associated with improved LC survival were less commonly found in black individuals. The overall mortality in the NLST was higher for black individuals than white individuals, but improved in black individuals screened, suggesting that this subgroup may have had improved access to care. To realize the reductions in mortality from LC screening, dissemination efforts need to be tailored to meet the needs of this community.","['Tanner, NT', 'Gebregziabher, M', 'Hughes Halbert, C', 'Payne, E', 'Egede, LE', 'Silvestri, GA']",10.1164/rccm.201502-0259OC
"Efficacy and Safety of Niraparib as Maintenance Treatment in Patients With Extensive-Stage SCLC After First-Line Chemotherapy: a Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase 3 Study","INTRODUCTION: ZL‐2306‐005 is a randomized, double‐blind, multicenter phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of niraparib, a poly(adenosine diphosphate‐ribose) polymerase inhibitor, as first‐line maintenance therapy in Chinese patients with platinum‐responsive, extensive‐stage SCLC (ES‐SCLC). METHODS: Patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to standardized, platinum‐based first‐line chemotherapy were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo (300 mg [baseline body weight ≥ 77 kg, platelet count ≥ 150,000/μL] or 200 mg) once daily until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary end points were progression‐free survival (PFS) (blinded independent central review) and overall survival (sample size planned: 591 patients). Secondary end points included investigator‐evaluated PFS and safety. RESULTS: ZL‐2306‐005 was terminated early owing to ES‐SCLC treatment landscape changes (data cutoff: March 20, 2020). During July 2018‐February 2020, a total of 185 of 272 patients screened were randomized (niraparib: n = 125 [CR = 1, PR = 124]; placebo: n = 60 [CR = 1, PR = 59]). Median (95% confidence interval [CI]) PFS (blinded independent central review) was 1.54 months (1.41‐2.69, niraparib) and 1.36 months (1.31‐1.48, placebo); hazard ratio (HR) = 0.66 (95% CI: 0.46‐0.95, p = 0.0242). Median overall survival was 9.92 months (9.33‐13.54, niraparib) and 11.43 months (9.53‐not estimable, placebo); HR = 1.03 (95% CI: 0.62‐1.73, p = 0.9052). Median investigator‐evaluated PFS was 1.48 months (1.41‐2.56, niraparib) and 1.41 months (1.31‐2.00, placebo); HR = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.61‐1.26; p = 0.4653). Grade greater than or equal to 3 adverse events occurred in 34.4% (niraparib) and 25.0% (placebo) of patients. CONCLUSIONS: ZL‐2306‐005 did not reach primary end points. Nevertheless, niraparib as maintenance therapy modestly improved PFS in patients with platinum‐responsive ES‐SCLC, with acceptable tolerability profile and no new safety signal.","['Ai, X', 'Pan, Y', 'Shi, J', 'Yang, N', 'Liu, C', 'Zhou, J', 'Zhang, X', 'Dong, X', 'He, J', 'Li, X', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.jtho.2021.04.001
Avelumab Versus Docetaxel in Patients With Platinum-Treated Advanced NSCLC: 2-Year Follow-Up From the JAVELIN Lung 200 Phase 3 Trial,"INTRODUCTION: In the JAVELIN Lung 200 trial, avelumab (anti‐programmed death‐ligand 1 [PD‐L1] antibody) did not significantly prolong overall survival (OS) versus docetaxel in patients with platinum‐treated PD‐L1+ NSCLC. We report greater than 2‐year follow‐up data. METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB or IV or recurrent NSCLC with disease progression after platinum‐doublet chemotherapy were randomized 1:1 to avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. The primary end point was OS in patients with PD‐L1+ tumors (greater than or equal to 1% tumor cell expression; IHC 73‐10 pharmDx assay). RESULTS: Of 792 patients, 529 had PD‐L1+ tumors (264 versus 265 in the avelumab versus docetaxel arms, respectively). As of March 4, 2019, median duration of follow‐up for OS in the PD‐L1+ population was 35.4 months in the avelumab arm and 34.7 months in the docetaxel arm; study treatment was ongoing in 25 (9.5%) versus 0 patients, respectively. In the PD‐L1+ population, 2‐year OS rates (95% confidence interval [CI]) with avelumab versus docetaxel were 29.9% (24.5%‐35.5%) versus 20.5% (15.6%‐25.8%); in greater than or equal to 50% PD‐L1+ subgroups, 2‐year OS rates were 36.4% (29.1%‐43.7%) versus 17.7% (11.8%‐24.7%) and in the greater than or equal to 80% subgroup were 40.2% (31.3%‐49.0%) versus 20.3% (12.9%‐28.8%), respectively. Median duration of response (investigator assessed) was 19.1 months (95% CI: 10.8‐34.8) versus 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.1‐8.3). Safety profiles for both arms were consistent with the primary analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the JAVELIN Lung 200 primary analysis (reported previously) revealed that avelumab did not significantly prolong OS versus docetaxel in patients with platinum‐treated PD‐L1+ NSCLC, posthoc analyses at 2 years of follow‐up revealed that 2‐year OS rates were doubled with avelumab in subgroups with higher PD‐L1 expression (greater than or equal to 50% and greater than or equal to 80%).","['Park, K', 'Özgüroğlu, M', 'Vansteenkiste, J', 'Spigel, D', 'Yang, JCH', 'Ishii, H', 'Garassino, M', 'de Marinis, F', 'Szczesna, A', 'Polychronis, A', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.jtho.2021.03.009
Randomized Phase 2 Studies of Checkpoint Inhibitors Alone or in Combination With Pegilodecakin in Patients With Metastatic NSCLC (CYPRESS 1 and CYPRESS 2),"INTRODUCTION: Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) have been approved to treat metastatic NSCLC. Pegilodecakin + CPI suggested promising efficacy in phase 1 IVY, providing rationale for randomized phase 2 trials CYPRESS 1 and CYPRESS 2. METHODS: CYPRESS 1 (N = 101) and CYPRESS 2 (N = 52) included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 and first‐line/second‐line metastatic NSCLC, respectively, without known EGFR/ALK mutations. Patients were randomized 1:1; control arms received pembrolizumab (CYPRESS 1) or nivolumab (CYPRESS 2); experimental arms received pegilodecakin + CPI. Patients had programmed death‐ligand 1 tumor proportion score of greater than or equal to 50% (CYPRESS 1) or 0% to 49% (CYPRESS 2). Primary end point was objective response rate (ORR) per investigator. Secondary end points included progression‐free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Exploratory end points included immune activation biomarkers. RESULTS: Median follow‐up for CYPRESS 1 and CYPRESS 2 was 10.0 and 11.6 months, respectively. Results for pegilodecakin + pembrolizumab versus pembrolizumab were as follows: ORR per investigator 47% versus 44% (OR = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.5‐2.5); median PFS 6.3 versus 6.1 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.937, 95% CI: 0.54‐1.625); and median OS 16.3 months versus not reached (HR = 1.507, 95% CI: 0.708‐3.209). Results per blinded independent central review were consistent. Treatment discontinuation rate owing to adverse events (AEs) doubled in the experimental arm (32% versus 15%). AEs with grade greater than or equal to 3 treatment‐related AEs (62% versus 19%) included anemia (20% versus 0%) and thrombocytopenia (12% versus 2%). Results for pegilodecakin + nivolumab versus nivolumab were as follows: ORR per investigator 15% versus 12% (OR = 1.2, 95% CI: 0.3‐5.9); median PFS 1.9 versus 1.9 months (HR = 1.006, 95% CI: 0.519‐1.951); and median OS 6.7 versus 10.7 months (HR = 1.871, 95% CI: 0.772‐4.532). AEs with grade greater than or equal to 3 treatment‐related AEs (70.4% versus 16.7%) included anemia (40.7% versus 0%), fatigue (18% versus 0%), and thrombocytopenia (14.8% versus 0%). Biomarker data suggested activation of immunostimulatory signals of interleukin‐10R pathway in pegilodecakin‐containing arms. CONCLUSIONS: Despite evidence of biological effect in peripheral blood, adding pegilodecakin to CPI did not improve ORR, PFS, or OS, in first‐line/second‐line NSCLC. Pegilodecakin + CPI has been found to have overall higher toxicity compared with CPI alone, leading to doubling of treatment discontinuation rate owing to AEs.","['Spigel, D', 'Jotte, R', 'Nemunaitis, J', 'Shum, M', 'Schneider, J', 'Goldschmidt, J', 'Eisenstein, J', 'Berz, D', 'Seneviratne, L', 'Socoteanu, M', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.jtho.2020.10.001
Tislelizumab Plus Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatment for Locally Advanced or Metastatic Nonsquamous NSCLC (RATIONALE 304): a Randomized Phase 3 Trial,"Introduction: Tislelizumab, an anti–programmed cell death protein‐1 antibody, was specifically engineered to minimize FcɣR macrophage binding to abrogate antibody‐dependent phagocytosis. Compared with chemotherapy alone, tislelizumab plus chemotherapy may improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC (nsq‐NSCLC). Methods: In this open‐label phase 3 trial (RATIONALE 304; NCT03663205), patients with histologically confirmed stage IIIB or IV nsq‐NSCLC were randomized (2:1) to receive either arm A: tislelizumab plus platinum (carboplatin or cisplatin) and pemetrexed every 3 weeks (Q3Ws) or arm B: platinum and pemetrexed alone Q3W during induction treatment, followed by intravenous maintenance pemetrexed Q3W. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS) assessed by an independent review committee; clinical response and safety and tolerability were secondary end points. Results: Overall, 332 patients (n = 222 [A]; n = 110 [B]) received treatment. With a median study follow‐up of 9.8 months, PFS was significantly longer with tislelizumab plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (median PFS: 9.7 versus 7.6 mo; hazard ratio = 0.645 [95% confidence interval: 0.462–0.902], p = 0.0044). In addition, response rates were higher and response duration was longer with combination therapy versus chemotherapy alone. Hematologic adverse events (AEs) were common in both treatment arms; the most reported AEs were grades 1 to 2 in severity. The most common grade greater than or equal to 3 AEs were associated with chemotherapy and included neutropenia (44.6% [A]; 35.5% [B]) and leukopenia (21.6% [A]; 14.5% [B]). Conclusions: Addition of tislelizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly prolonged PFS, higher response rates, and longer response duration compared with chemotherapy alone, identifying a new potential option for first‐line treatment of advanced nsq‐NSCLC irrespective of disease stage.","['Lu, S', 'Wang, J', 'Yu, Y', 'Yu, X', 'Hu, Y', 'Ai, X', 'Ma, Z', 'Li, X', 'Zhuang, W', 'Liu, Y', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.jtho.2021.05.005
Updated Overall Survival Analysis From IMpower110: atezolizumab Versus Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in Treatment-Naive Programmed Death-Ligand 1-Selected NSCLC,"Introduction: IMpower110 previously revealed significant overall survival (OS) benefit with atezolizumab versus chemotherapy in patients with treatment‐naive EGFR‐ and ALK‐negative (wild type [WT]) metastatic NSCLC with high programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression (≥50% on tumor cells [TCs] or ≥10% on tumor‐infiltrating immune cells [ICs], per SP142 immunohistochemistry assay; p = 0.0106). We present primary OS analyses in lower PD‐L1 expression groups and an updated, exploratory analysis in the high PD‐L1 expression group. Methods: This open‐label, phase 3 trial randomized patients with PD‐L1 expression on greater than or equal to 1% of TC or IC to receive atezolizumab or platinum‐based chemotherapy. The primary end point was OS, hierarchically tested in PD‐L1 expression WT subgroups: first the high PD‐L1 expression subgroup, then the high‐or‐intermediate PD‐L1 expression subgroup (≥5% on TC or IC), and then the any PD‐L1 expression subgroup (≥1% on TC or IC). Results: The any PD‐L1 expression WT population included 554 patients (excluded 18 EGFR‐ or ALK‐positive patients). With 17 months’ additional follow‐up, OS improvement in the atezolizumab versus chemotherapy arm was not statistically significant in high‐or‐intermediate PD‐L1 expression WT patients (n = 328; hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.66–1.14, p = 0.3091; median = 19.9 versus 16.1 mo), precluding formal OS testing in any PD‐L1 expression WT patients. Exploratory analysis in high PD‐L1 expression WT patients (n = 205) revealed maintained OS benefit in the atezolizumab arm (hazard ratio = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.54–1.09; median = 20.2 versus 14.7 mo). Updated safety data continued to favor atezolizumab. Conclusions: Statistical significance for OS was not revealed in the high‐or‐intermediate expression WT group, and, as a result, OS in the any PD‐L1 expression WT group was not formally tested. No new safety signals were found. This updated analysis of IMpower110 supports using atezolizumab in treatment‐naive, metastatic WT NSCLC with high PD‐L1 expression.","['Jassem, J', 'de Marinis, F', 'Giaccone, G', 'Vergnenegre, A', 'Barrios, CH', 'Morise, M', 'Felip, E', 'Oprean, C', 'Kim, YC', 'Andric, Z', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.jtho.2021.06.019
Racial disparities in cancer survival among randomized clinical trials patients of the southwest oncology group,"BackgroundRacial disparities in cancer outcomes have been observed in several malignancies. However, it is unclear if survival differences persist after adjusting for clinical, demographic, and treatment variables. Our objective was to determine whether racial disparities in survival exist among patients enrolled in consecutive trials conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG).MethodsWe identified 19457 adult cancer patients (6676 with breast, 2699 with lung, 1244 with colon, 1429 with ovarian, and 1843 with prostate cancers; 1291 with lymphoma; 2067 with leukemia; and 2208 with multiple myeloma) who were treated on 35 SWOG randomized phase III clinical trials from October 1, 1974, through November 29, 2001. Patients were grouped according to studies of diseases with similar histology and stage. Cox regression was used to evaluate the association between race and overall survival within each disease site grouping, controlling for available prognostic factors plus education and income, which are surrogates for socioeconomic status. Median and ten‐year overall survival estimates were derived by the Kaplan‐Meier method. All statistical tests were two‐sided.ResultsOf 19457 patients registered, 2308 (11.9%, range = 3.9%‐21.6%) were African American. After adjustment for prognostic factors, African American race was associated with increased mortality in patients with early‐stage premenopausal breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] for death = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10 to 1.82; P =. 007), early‐stage postmenopausal breast cancer (HR for death = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.28 to 1.73; P <. 001), advanced‐stage ovarian cancer (HR for death = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.18 to 2.18; P =. 002), and advanced‐stage prostate cancer (HR for death = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.37; P =. 001). No statistically significant association between race and survival for lung cancer, colon cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, or myeloma was observed. Additional adjustments for socioeconomic status did not substantially change these observations. Ten‐year (and median) overall survival rates for African American vs all other patients were 68% (not reached) vs 77% (not reached), respectively, for early‐stage, premenopausal breast cancer; 52% (10.2 years) vs 62% (13.5 years) for early‐stage, postmenopausal breast cancer; 13% (1.3 years) vs 17% (2.3 years) for advanced ovarian cancer; and 6% (2.2 years) vs 9% (2.7 years) for advanced prostate cancer.ConclusionsAfrican American patients with sex‐specific cancers had worse survival than white patients, despite enrollment on phase III SWOG trials with uniform stage, treatment, and follow‐up.","['Albain, KS', 'Unger, JM', 'Crowley, JJ', 'Coltman, CA', 'Hershman, DL']",10.1093/jnci/djp175
Lung cancer screening in a predominantly African-American population,"Purpose/Objective(s): The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that 320 people needed to be screened to save one life from lung cancer. However, these results may not be generalizable to populations differing from the trial demographics. We studied lung cancer screening in a predominantly African‐American community, hypothesizing that culturally sensitive care is necessary to preserve efficacy. Materials/Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on lung cancer screening participants within an urban academic health system with a predominantly African‐American population. Over a 6‐month period, we screened patients within a multidisciplinary lung cancer screening program with strict adherence to screening criteria. Culturally sensitive care included the use of a personalized shared decision making tool, smoking cessation counselling, and patient navigation to address barriers to follow‐up.We studied race, smoking history, Lung‐RADS category, and follow‐up of patients with nodules. Results: Over a 6‐month period, 128 people received a low dose CT scan for lung cancer screening. Of these, 87 (68%) were African‐American, 29 (23%) were Caucasian, 10 (8%) were Hispanic, and 2 (1%) were Asian. Smoking history was a mean of 48 pack years, median of 40 pack years. Sixty percent were current smokers compared to 50% in NLST. Thirtyeight (30%) had nodules greater than 4mm compared to 25% in NLST, 58 (45%) patients had no nodules, 58 (45%) had nodules with benign features, 6 (5%) had likely benign nodules, and 7 (5%) had nodules requiring additional diagnostic testing. Of patients requiring additional testing, 3 patients had stable or decreased diameter nodules, and 4 were lost to follow‐up. These 4 re‐established care after being contacted by the program. One of these patients was treated for lung cancer. Conclusion: Efficacy of lung cancer screening depends on follow‐up care and treatment when indicated. In a predominantly African‐American population, a culturally sensitive program with active patient navigation prevented the loss of follow‐up in three of four patients with suspected cancer and at least one patient with proven cancer.","['Erkmen, C', 'Mitchell, M']",
Impact of Comorbidities on Diagnostic Evaluation in Lung Cancer Screening in PLCO,"Background: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Annual lung cancer screening in the form of LDCT is recommended for eligible individuals to decrease lung cancer mortality. However, many individuals who meet eligibility criteria also have increased rates of other major tobacco‐related comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease (CAD), stroke, and diabetes mellitus (DM). Current screening recommendations suggest that screening should be avoided if individuals have a health problem limiting their ability to tolerate evaluation and treatment, however, there is limited evidence supporting this guideline. In this study, we used data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial to examine the impact of COPD, CAD, stroke, and DM on diagnostic complications in lung cancer screening evaluation. Methods: The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial is a large randomized trial designed and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Between November 8, 1993 to July 2, 2001, a total of 154,900 men and women were enrolled. Screened patients were ages 55‐74 at age of entry into the trial. In our analysis, we included individuals from both arms of the trial with equal or greater than 55 years of age with a 20 pack‐year smoking history who had undergone an invasive procedure (needle biopsy, bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, surgical biopsy, and other invasive procedures). Our primary outcome was the presence of combined major and intermediate complications. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the effect of comorbidity on complication, after adjusting for age, pack‐years, and procedure. Results: Our final study cohort consisted of 3032 patients. The overall mean age of diagnosis was 64. Approximately 63% of participants were male; the cohort was 90% white, non‐Hispanic (2725/3032). Individuals had a mean pack‐year of 62, with individuals reporting the following comorbidities: 18% COPD; 14% history of CAD; 8% DM; and 4% (109/3032) had history of stroke. Features associated with high‐risk complication under multivariate analysis included older age (OR=1.03 [1.01‐1.05], p=0.01), prior history of cardiac disease (OR=1.37 [1.04‐1.81], p=0.03), surgical biopsy (OR=7.09 [5.62‐8.94], p<0.001), needle biopsy (OR=1.93 [1.58‐2.36], p<0.001), and other invasive procedure (OR=1.58 [1.22‐2.05], p<0.001).Conclusions: Patient and procedure‐level factors may alter the benefits of lung cancer screening. Data concerning individual risk factors and high‐risk complications should therefore be incorporated into diagnostic algorithms to optimize clinical benefit and minimize harm. Further study and validation of the risk factors identified herein are warranted.","['Robinson, EM', 'Liu, B', 'Wisnivesky, JP', 'Kong, C', 'Kale, MS']",10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2021.TP136
Apatinib Plus Gefitinib as First-Line Treatment in Advanced EGFR-Mutant NSCLC: the Phase III ACTIVE Study (CTONG1706),"Introduction: Blocking vascular endothelial growth factor pathway can enhance the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in EGFR‐mutant NSCLC. ACTIVE is the first phase 3 study conducted in the People's Republic of China evaluating apatinib, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, plus gefitinib as first‐line therapy in EGFR‐mutant NSCLC. Methods: Treatment‐naive patients with stage IIIB or IV nonsquamous NSCLC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and EGFR exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R mutation were randomized 1:1 to receive oral gefitinib (250 mg/d), plus apatinib (500 mg/d; apatinib [A] + gefitinib [G] group), or placebo (placebo [P] + gefitinib [G] group). Stratification factors were mutation type, sex, and performance status. The primary end point was progression‐free survival (PFS) by blinded independent radiology review committee (IRRC). Secondary end points were investigator‐assessed PFS, overall survival, quality of life (QoL), safety, etc. Next‐generation sequencing was used to explore efficacy predictors and acquired resistance. Results: A total of 313 patients were assigned to the A + G (n = 157) or P + G group (n = 156). Median IRRC PFS in the A + G group was 13.7 months versus 10.2 months in the P + G group (hazard ratio 0.71, p = 0.0189). Investigator‐ and IRRC‐assessed PFS were similar. Overall survival was immature. The most common treatment‐emergent adverse events greater than or equal to grade 3 were hypertension (46.5%) and proteinuria (17.8%) in the A + G group and increased alanine aminotransferase (10.4%) and aspartate aminotransferase (3.2%) in the P + G group. QoL in the two groups had no statistical differences. Post hoc analysis revealed PFS benefits tended to favor the A + G group in patients with TP53 exon 8 mutation. Conclusions: Apatinib + gefitinib as first‐line therapy had superior PFS in advanced EGFR‐mutant NSCLC versus placebo + gefitinib. Combination therapy brought more adverse events but did not interfere QoL.

A phase 3 randomized trial of immediate combination chemotherapy vs delayed combination chemotherapy in patients with completely resected stage II and III non-small cell carcinoma of the lung,"The purpose of this trial (Lung Cancer Study Group [LCSG] 853) was to perform a comparative study of immediate combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, cisplatin [CAP]) vs delayed combination chemotherapy (CAP) administered at the time of first systemic relapse in patients with completely resected stage II and stage III non‐small cell cancer of the lung. We randomly assigned 188 patients with resected stage II or stage III non‐small cell lung cancer of the lung (squamous, 53%; nonsquamous, 47%) to receive either immediate or delayed combination chemotherapy. Careful intraoperative staging was performed in all patients. Before randomization, patients were stratified according to stage‐‐II (hilar nodes positive) vs III (mediastinal nodes positive or T3)‐‐and histologic features (squamous vs nonsquamous). Ninety‐four patients were randomized to receive immediate CAP vs 94 patients randomized to receive delayed CAP. Prognostic variables such as extent of disease, histologic features, sex, race, TN status, and Karnofsky performance status were equally distributed between randomized groups. The treatment groups differed with respect to greater than 10% weight loss. Forty‐one percent of patients had stage II disease and 59% of patients had stage III disease. Median time to recurrence (19.5 months) and survival (32.7 months) did not differ between treatment groups. Immediate combination chemotherapy was associated with a 12% reduction in risk of recurrence and an 18% reduction in risk of death, although these rates were not statistically significant. Histologic features, sex, race, Karnofsky performance status, nodal status, and weight change were associated with higher risks of recurrence.","['Figlin, RA', 'Piantodosi, S']",10.1378/chest.106.6_supplement.310s
Lung cancer screening patient navigation for current smokers in community health centers: a randomized controlled trial,"Background: Annual chest computed tomography (CT) can decrease lung cancer mortality in high risk individuals. Patient navigation (PN) has been shown to improve cancer screening rates in underserved populations. We evaluated the impact of PN on lung cancer screening (LCS) in current smokers in community health centers (CHC). Methods: Current smokers aged 55‐77 receiving care in five CHC afiliated with an academic medical center were randomized to intervention (n = 400) or control (n = 800) groups. In the intervention arm, patient navigators (PNs) determined eligibility for LCS, provided brief smoking cessation counseling, introduced shared decision making about LCS, scheduled appointments with the primary care provider (PCP), reminded patients about appointments and PCPs to order CTs, and helped patients attend testing and follow‐up any abnormal results. Control patients received usual care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients in each group who had any chest CT during the study period. Secondary outcomes included proportion of patients receiving lung screening CTs and the number of lung cancers diagnosed in each group. Results: Baseline patient characteristics were similar between randomized groups. From March 2016‐January 2017, PNs contacted 332 (83%) of intervention patients; 76 refused further participation. Of participating patients, 130 (51%) were eligible for LCS. Exclusions included insufficient smoking history (n = 117), competing comorbidities (n = 5), moved (n = 2), and died (n = 2). In intention‐to‐treat analyses, 124 intervention patients (31%) had chest CT vs. 138 control patients (17.3%, p < 0.01). Lung cancer screening CTs were performed in 94 intervention patients (23.5%) vs. 69 control patients (8.6%, p < 0.01). Eight lung cancers were diagnosed in intervention patients (2%) vs. 4 in controls (0.5%). Conclusions: A patient navigation program implemented in community health centers significantly increased lung cancer screening among current smokers. PNs may help underserved low‐income current smokers complete LCS and improve equity in care while decreasing lung cancer mortality.","['Percac-Lima, S', 'Ashburner, JM', 'Rigotti, N', 'Park, ER', 'Chang, Y', 'Atlas, SJ']",
Feasibility and effectiveness of inhaled carboplatin in NSCLC patients,"BACKGROUND: Inhaled chemotherapy is under investigation as an alternative therapeutic modality for Non‐Small Cell Lung Cancer. METHODS: 60 NSCLC patients were randomized into 3 groups in this study. 20/60 patients (group A‐control group) received I.V. chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC ≈ 5.5 D1); 20/60 (group B) received 2/3 of I.V. predicted carboplatin dose by I.V. infusion and the rest 1/3 as aerosol (jet nebulised D1); and 20/60 (group C) received all the predicted I.V. dose of carboplatin as aerosol in 3 equally divided fractions D1‐3. In all patients I.V. docetaxel 100/m(2) was as well administered (D1). Lung functional tests were performed in all groups before chemotherapy in the 3rd and 6th cycles. RESULTS: Group B had a statistically significant increase in survival compared to control group A [275 days (95% CI 249‐300) vs. 211 (95% CI 185‐236)]. In regard to lung functional tests, a statistically significant decline was observed only in FEV1 of group C in 6 months compared to the initial measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled carboplatin could be given as an alternative root of pulmonary drug delivery in selected patients, but further randomized studies remain to prove whether the inhaled chemotherapy is an efficient and safe treatment modality.","['Zarogoulidis, P', 'Eleftheriadou, E', 'Sapardanis, I', 'Zarogoulidou, V', 'Lithoxopoulou, H', 'Kontakiotis, T', 'Karamanos, N', 'Zachariadis, G', 'Mabroudi, M', 'Zisimopoulos, A', 'et al.']",10.1007/s10637-011-9714-5
First-line dacomitinib versus gefitinib in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutation subgroups,"Background: The ARCHER 1050 study (NCT01774721) demonstrated benefits of dacomitinib compared with gefitinib as first‐line therapy for patients with advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EGFR‐activating mutation. Here, we present the results of a prospective subgroup analysis by EGFR mutation subtype. Method: In this ongoing phase 3, open‐label study, eligible patients with newly diagnosed stage IIIb/IV or recurrent NSCLC and EGFRactivating mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation ± T790M mutation) with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0‐1 were randomized (1:1) to receive dacomitinib or gefitinib, stratified by race and EGFR mutation subtype. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) by blinded independent radiologic central (IRC) review. Secondary endpoints included overall survival and objective response rate (ORR), as determined by IRC and investigators' assessments. Result: A total of 452 patients were randomized (dacomitinib, n=227; gefitinib, n=225). Among the dacomitinib and gefitinib arms, respectively, 134 (59%) and 133 (59%) had exon 19 deletions and 93 (41%) and 92 (41%) had L858R mutations. The Table shows PFS, ORR, and duration of response by EGFR mutation per IRC. Results based on investigators' assessments were consistent with those based on IRC review. Overall survival data are immature. Conclusion: By IRC and investigators' assessments, PFS with dacomitinib was superior to that with gefitinib in patients with either EGFR mutation. Despite a similar ORR among the treatment and EGFR mutation subgroups, duration of response was longer with dacomitinib for both mutations.","['Wu, Y', 'Cheng, Y', 'Zhou, X', 'Lee, KH', 'Nakagawa, K', 'Niho, S', 'Tsuji, F', 'Rosell, R', 'Corral, J', 'Migliorino, MR', 'et al.']",
Adjuvant chemotherapy may improve long-term outcomes in stage IB non-small cell lung cancer patients with previous malignancies: a propensity score-matched analysis,"Background: Routine administration of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage IB non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. To our knowledge, no available studies have assessed the outcomes of chemotherapy in patients with stage IB NSCLC who had prior malignancies. Methods: Patients with pathological stage IB NSCLC with previous malignancies who underwent surgery between 2004 and 2015 were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The patients were categorized into chemotherapy and observation group based on whether they received adjuvant chemotherapy. Propensity score matching was performed to reduce confounding bias, and Kaplan–Meier curves and log‐rank tests were used to compare overall survival (OS) and cancer‐specific survival (CSS) between the two groups. Subgroup analyses of the matched cohorts were then conducted to evaluate the relationship between clinical features and chemotherapy. Results: A total of 894 eligible patients were identified; 90 (10.1%) patients received postoperative chemotherapy. Patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy obtained obvious OS benefits compared with those who received observation alone (HR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.48–0.97, P = 0.031). In addition, the 5‐year OS rate and median OS time in the chemotherapy group were higher and longer, respectively. Although chemotherapy offered no obvious benefits for CSS (HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.57–1.14, P = 0.35), patients who received chemotherapy showed a better 5‐year CSS rate. On subgroup analyses, a chemotherapy advantage was observed in advanced age (≥65 years, HR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.38–0.99, P = 0.045). The same chemotherapy advantages were observed in patients diagnosed with higher histological grades (poorly differentiated to undifferentiated) (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.33–0.96, P = 0.033) and tumor sizes >3.1–4 cm (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.37–0.87, P = 0.010). Interestingly, NSCLC patients with previous malignancies originating from the kidney and bladder (HR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.12–0.99, P = 0.049) showed a chemotherapy advantage. The same chemotherapy advantages were observed in patients diagnosed with NSCLC within 3 to 5 years after prior cancers (HR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.16–0.98, P = 0.044) and with localized SEER stage of prior cancers (HR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.29–0.86, P = 0.012). Conclusion: These findings indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy may improve long‐term outcomes for stage IB NSCLC patients with previous malignancies. It is recommended that physicians consider the clinical features of previous cancers when making adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for these patients.","['Zhou, K', 'Zhao, Y', 'Liang, L', 'Cao, J', 'Lin, H', 'Peng, Z', 'Mei, J']",10.3389/fonc.2022.938195
Treatment of cancer-related anorexia with olanzapine and megestrol acetate: a randomized trial,"PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of megestrol acetate (MA) and olanzapine (OLN) for the treatment of cancer‐related anorexia (CRA). METHODS: Eighty adult patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer or lung cancer (stages III and IV) with CRA (loss of appetite and greater than or equal to 5% loss of preillness stable weight) were randomized to receive daily MA or MA plus OLN for a period of 8 weeks. Patients were assessed weekly using the M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory with specific measurement of weight, appetite, nausea, and quality of life (QOL) measures. RESULTS: For the 37 patients receiving MA, 15 patients had a greater than or equal to 5% weight gain, 2 patients had an appetite improvement, 3 patients had an improvement in nausea, and 5 patients had an improvement in QOL at both 4 and 8 weeks. For the 39 patients receiving MA plus OLN, 33 patients had a greater than or equal to 5% weight gain, 25 patients had an appetite improvement, 21 patients had an improvement in nausea, and 23 patients had an improvement in QOL at both 4 and 8 weeks, and there was an improvement in general activity, mood, work, walking, and enjoyment at 8 weeks. There were no grade III or IV treatment‐related toxicities in patients receiving MA or the combination of MA plus OLN. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of MA and OLN appears to be an effective intervention for patients with CRA.","['Navari, RM', 'Brenner, MC']",10.1007/s00520-009-0739-7
Cyclophosphamide and CCNU in the treatment of inoperable small cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung,"Two hundred and fifty‐eight patients with small cell carcinoma and 185 patients with adenocarcinoma were centrally randomized to receive either cyclophosphamide (1000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) iv or cyclophosphamide (700 mg/m2 every 3 weeks) iv plus CCNU (70 mg/m2 every 6 weeks) orally. Those patients who were initially treated with the single agent were then treated with CCNU (130 mg/m2 every 6 weeks) at the time of cyclophosphamide failure. Objective tumor regression occurred more frequently with the combination regimen in patients with small cell carcinoma (43% vs 22%, P = 0.002), but no difference in response rates was apparent in patients with adenocarcinoma. In both cell types patients survived somewhat longer following treatment with the combination. The overall incidence of severe toxicity was equal for the two regimens in both cell types; however, the therapeutic index of the combination was superior to that of the single agent in small cell carcinoma. Severe drug toxicity was more frequent in small cell carcinoma patients with extensive disease, and survival was reduced in both cell types with extensive disease. Survival was better for ambulatory patients in both cell types and women survived longer than men. In women with small cell carcinoma, ambulatory status also was associated with a higher incidence of tumor regression. In patients with small cell carcinoma those who had prior lung surgery survived longer than those without prior surgery. Previous radiation therapy was associated with a reduced incidence of objective regression in men with small cell carcinoma. In both cell types patients with tumor regression lived longer than nonresponders; however, objective disease stability was associated with improved survival only in patients with adenocarcinoma. Stratification in future studies should consider extent of disease, performance status, sex, and prior therapy.","['Edmonson, JH', 'Lagakos, SW', 'Selawry, OS', 'Perlia, CP', 'Bennett, JM', 'Muggia, FM', 'Wampler, G', 'Brodovsky, HS', 'Horton, J', 'Colsky, J', 'et al.']",
Prophylactic Cranial Irradiation (PCI) and Consolidative Thoracic Radiation (TRT) in Extensive Stage Small Cell (ES-SCLC) Lung Cancer,"Purpose/Objective(s): Small cell lung cancer accounts for 10‐15% of all lung cancers. Majority of patients present with extensive stage disease (ES‐SCLC). Two‐year survival is poor, with median survival ranging from 7‐10 months. The role of PCI remains controversial in ES‐SCLC given conflicting results from randomized trials. Similarly, routine thoracic radiation (TRT) while had shown significant benefit in improving local control, given high incidence of systemic recurrence has not been adopted widely. It has been our practice to consider PCI and TRT in patients with no evidence of disease progression after initial chemotherapy. Here, we report our single institution retrospective analysis of patients undergoing PCI or intrathoracic radiotherapy after chemotherapy. Materials/Methods: Patients with ES‐SCLC diagnosis who did not have brain metastasis at initial diagnosis and completed initial chemotherapy from 2009–2018 are included with IRB approval. We collected demographic information, sites of metastatic disease, and treatment details. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan‐Meier estimates with log‐rank testing for comparison. We evaluated use of PCI, TRT, age, race and number of sites of disease for overall survival. Results: From our small cell lung cancer database, 137 patients met the criteria and are included in the analysis. The median age was 65.6 years (43 – 91) with 70% being males and 73% being white race. 56 patients received TRT and 34 patients received PCI. The median TRT dose was 32.5 Gy (20 – 60 Gy). Liver (51%) was most common metastatic site followed by bone, 36%. The median overall survival for all patients was 9 months, with 12‐ and 18‐month survival being 31.6% and 11.8%. The median overall survival with PCI was 13 months compared to 7 months with no PCI (p<0.0001). Similarly, TRT improved median survival to 12 months versus 6 months without (p<0.003). The overall survival of patients receiving both PCI and TRT compared to none was 13 vs 5 months (p = 0.0001). Patients receiving PCI or TRT, younger age ≤ 65 years had improved median OS compared to > 65 years, 14 vs 11 months (p = 0.026). Race, sex and number of metastatic sites were not significant. Conclusion: Our single institutional result suggested benefit of both PCI and TRT in these patient populations who had any response to chemotherapy. Recently, the addition of immune check point inhibitor to platinum‐etoposide in ES‐SCLC have shown improvement in median survival from 10 to 13 months. Future trials are needed to evaluate the role of PCI and TRT in combination with chemo‐immunotherapy.","['Gross, AJ', 'Kharouta, MZ', 'Chaung, KV', 'Choi, S', 'Machtay, M', 'Bruno, D', 'Patel, M', 'Dowlati, A', 'Biswas, T']",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.07.1348
Using Telehealth Strategies to Increase Shared Decision Making for Lung Cancer Screening: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial,"RATIONALE: Uptake of lung cancer screening (LCS) using low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT) remains suboptimal in the United States due in part to the substantial challenges of identifying and engaging screening‐eligible patients in shared decision making (SDM). Tele health strategies have been proposed as a potential approach to addressing these challenges within and across healthcare systems. METHODS: Guided by principles from behavioral economics and implementation science, we conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial to test the feasibility and effectiveness of tele health strategies on completion of SDM visits for LCS (primary outcome), LDCT uptake among screening‐eligible patients (secondary outcome), and eligibility assessment (exploratory outcome). Primary care patients at a multisite healthcare system who met study eligibility (currently smoked, age 55‐77, and no history of lung cancer or LDCT in medical record) were randomized (1:1) to the centralized or primary care arm. All randomized patients received direct email and/or text messaging outreach asking them to complete a brief online survey assessing LCS eligibility. Patients who confirmed LCS eligibility were invited to participate in the full study, which included receiving information about risks and benefits of LCS and answering additional survey questions about LCS knowledge, beliefs, and decision‐making. All enrolled patients, regardless of arm, were provided with a validated LCS decision tool (asynchronous strategy); however, patients in the centralized arm had the option of having the LCS navigator contact them to schedule a synchronous tele health SDM visit while patients in the primary care arm were simply encouraged to discuss LCS with their primary care clinician. We used logistic regression to assess effect of interventions on primary and secondary outcomes in all randomized patients (intention‐to‐treat analyses). RESULTS: Among the 4,587 randomized patients (50.4% centralized; 49.6% primary care), the majority were aged 65 or older (52.4%) and male (52.8%). 64.1% identified as White and 29% as Black race in the medical record. 409 (8.9%) completed the eligibility assessment, of which 137 (33.5%) met LCS eligibility and enrolled in the study. In comparison to patients in the primary care arm, patients randomized to the centralized arm were significantly more likely to complete a SDM visit [OR: 7.5 (95% CI: 2.6, 21.2)] and LDCT [OR: 2.0 (95% CI: 1.1, 3.6] within 8 weeks of initial outreach. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of asynchronous patient outreach with centralized tele health visits is an effective and low‐touch strategy for increasing SDM and LDCT completion but not sufficient by itself for reaching all screening‐eligible patients.","['Rendle, K', 'Steltz, JP', 'Cohen, S', 'Saia, CA', 'Wainwright, JV', 'Vachani, A']",10.1164/ajrccm-conference.2023.D22
Adjuvant systemic therapy in patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy,"Background: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is currently the standard of care for inoperable patients with early stage non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite this, z20% will relapse at 2 years. While adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for surgically resected patients with early stage NSCLC (IB‐IIIA), data on the role of adjuvant systemic therapy following SBRT for early stage NSCLC are sparse. The goal of this study was to evaluate the role of adjuvant chemotherapy following SBRT in early‐stage, inoperable NSCLC. Method: Adults diagnosed with early‐stage (clinical stage I and II) between the years of 2004 and 2013 were identified from the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Variables abstracted included: age, gender, clinical stage, race, comorbidity, insurance status, treating facility, treatment received and survival. Chi‐square tests were used to compare clinical characteristics by therapy type. Kaplan‐Meier, Cox regression, and propensity score analyses were employed for survival analyses. Result: Data from 12,414 patients with early‐stage NSCLC were analyzed. Of these, 75.6% and 25.4% had clinical stage I and II disease, respectively. A total of 9,164 (73.6%) patients received SBRT alone and 3,268 (26.4%) had SBRT followed by chemotherapy. Among patients with clinical stage I, 83.5% received SBRT alone and 16.5% received SBRT followed by chemotherapy. Among those with clinical stage II, 43% received SBRT alone while 57% received SBRT followed by systemic therapy. On multivariate analysis, increasing age, male gender and stage II disease were associated with worse overall survival (OS). There was evidence of a clinical stage by treatment interaction (p <0.001). When treatment effect was analyzed by stage after adjusting for age and gender, patients with stage I treated with SBRT alone had a better median OS, 26.2 months compared to 22.4 months in the combined arm (HR=0.78; p<0.001; CI: 0.73‐0.83). In contrast, among patients with stage II NSCLC, median OS was 15 months in the SBRT compared to 20.2 months in the combined group (HR=1.3; p<0.001; CI: 1.22‐1.44). Conclusion: SBRT should be the sole modality treatment for patients with inoperable stage I NSCLC. However, patients with stage II disease appear to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Randomized trials are needed in this area to answer this question conclusively.","['Ernani, V', 'Appiah, A', 'Marr, A', 'Smith, L', 'Ganti, AK']",
Comparison of thoracoscopic segmentectomy and thoracoscopic lobectomy on the patients with non-small cell lung cancer: a propensity score matching study,"OBJECTIVES: Thoracoscopic lobectomy has been widely performed on patients with early‐stage lung cancer; meanwhile indications of thoracoscopic segmentectomy have not been clearly defined due to technical difficulties and unclear oncological outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare early and late outcomes between thoracoscopic segmentectomy and thoracoscopic lobectomy. METHODS: Between January 2005 and December 2013, 100 thoracoscopic segmentectomies and 1049 thoracoscopic lobectomies were performed on patients with lung cancer in our institute. Preoperative clinical parameters including gender, age, tumour size, pathological stage, histology and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were used for propensity score matching. After propensity score matching, 94 thoracoscopic segmentectomies and 94 lobectomies were selected and compared. RESULTS: Thoracoscopic segmentectomies were performed on patients with normal lung function (mean FEV1 = 101.6 +/‐ 24.1%), smallsized tumour (mean diameter 1.7 +/‐ 1.0 cm), early‐stage cancer (Stage I 93.7%) and predominant adenocarcinoma (81.9%). The lobectomy group had similar clinical features with the segmentectomy group. Most commonly performed procedures were left upper lobe upper division segmentectomy (19%) and right lower lobe superior segmentectomy (17%). Segmentectomies were performed in all lobes except the right middle lobe. There were no differences between segmentectomy and lobectomy in terms of operation time (166.3 +/‐ 54.7 min vs 181.1 +/‐ 85.2 min, P = 0.47) and hospital stay (6.2 +/‐ 5.2 days vs 7.1 +/‐ 7.1 days, P = 0.31). Incidence of postoperative complications was nonsignificantly higher in the lobectomy group (17.2 vs 10.6%, P = 0.1), and postoperative mortality rates were also non‐significantly higher in the segmentectomy group (1.1 vs 2.1%, P = 0.56). Postoperative FEV1 decrease was non‐significantly lower in the segmentectomy group (8.9 +/‐ 10.8 vs 11.0 +/‐ 13.1, P = 0.36). The 3‐year overall survival and recurrence‐free survival was not different between the two groups (94 and 87% in the segmentectomy group and 96 and 94% in the lobectomy group, P = 0.62 and P = 0.69, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracoscopic segmentectomy could achieve equal short‐term surgical results and long‐term oncological outcomes compared with thoracoscopic lobectomy.","['Hwang, Y', 'Kang, CH', 'Kim, H-S', 'Jeon, JH', 'Park, IK', 'Kim, YT']",10.1093/ejcts/ezu422
Randomized phase III trial in extensive-disease small cell lung cancer comparing first-line etoposide to topotecan in combination with platinum,"Background: Randomized trials in extensive disease (ED) small cell lung cancer (SCLC) comparing the camptothecins to standard etoposide based chemotherapy have reached conflicting results. Here we report the results of an interim analysis of a phase III trial randomly allocating patients (pts) with ED SCLC to etoposide or topotecan in combination with platinum. Methods: Previously untreated pts with ED SCLC were randomized to six cycles of T (topotecan 2.0 mg/m2 IV, day 1‐3; cisplatin 50 mg/m2 IV, day 3) or E (etoposide 120 mg/m2, day 1‐3; carboplatin IV AUC = 5, day 1) every 3 weeks. Primary end‐point was overall survival (OS) and secondary end‐points were response, progression‐free survival (PFS), and safety. A sample size of 380 pts was estimated to detect an increase in 2‐year survival from 7.5 to 15 % (α=0.05, β=0.20.) ClinicalTrials.gov NCT 00812266. Results: The trial was prematurely stopped due to poor accrual according to a pre‐planned interim analysis after the accrual of 281 pts reducing power to 0.66. Prognostic factors were equally balanced between arms. WHO performance status > 2 were recorded in 20.0% and 50% were females. Median age was 64 years (40 ‐ 82). Most frequent grade 3/4 non‐hematological adverse events (AEs) were infections (E 17.1 vs T 12.1%) and fatigue (E 14.2 vs T 12.7%). Most common grade 1/2 non‐hematological AEs were alopecia (E 91.3 vs T 88.0%), nausea (E 55.9 vs T 57.9%) vomiting (E 27.6 vs T 24.1%), auditory toxicity (E 25.2 vs T 33.8%), and neuropathy (E 33.9 vs T 39.8%). Grade 4 leuco‐ and thrombocytopenia were observed in 21.1 and 12.8% of pts in arm E, respectively, compared to 6.7 and 5.2% in arm T (p < 0.01). Overall response rates were 69.1 % in arm E compared to 59.8% in arm T (NS). Median PFS was 6.6 months in E arm and 6.9 month in arm T, HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.72‐1.19, p=0.55. Median OS and 2‐yr survival rates were 10.9 months and 9.2% in arm T, compared to 9.8 months and 8.7% in arm E, respectively, HR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.67‐1.17, p=0.26. Conclusions: No differences in OS or PFS were observed comparing first line E with T in ED SCLC. Significantly more hematological toxicity was noted in the E arm.

The role of postoperative radiation therapy in pN2 non-small cell lung cancer: an analysis of the national cancer data base,"Purpose/Objective(s): The role of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) in the treatment of pathologic N2 (pN2) nonesmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial. A heterogeneous set of trials and metaanalyses conducted over a long period of time have come to differing conclusions. We investigated national practice patterns for patients with pN2 NSCLC treated with surgery and multiagent chemotherapy and the impact of modern PORT on OS using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Materials/Methods: Patients with known histologies of pN2 NSCLC who underwent surgery with negative margins and received adjuvant multiagent chemotherapy from 2004‐2013 were identified from the NCDB and stratified by the use of PORT (45 Gy). Patients also had to have survived at least 98 days after chemotherapy initiation to be included, so that patients were only included if they were expected to survive long enough to receive adjuvant therapy. To prevent receipt of concurrent chemoradiation, patients in the PORT group received radiation 84 days from the initiation date of chemotherapy. Landmark analysis was set at 120 days following the initiation date of adjuvant chemotherapy to prevent survival bias in the non‐PORT group, as this was the median time to initiation of PORT. Multivariable proportional hazards modelling was used to examine factors associated with receiving PORT and the association of treatment and mortality adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and clinicopathologic factors. Results: A total of 2,815 patients were identified with median follow‐up of 32.5 months. Improved survival was associated with female sex, lower Charlson‐Deyo comorbidity index, race, smaller tumor size, squamous histology, lobectomy as surgery performed and receipt of PORT. Prior to landmark analysis, the HR showed a benefit to PORT. This benefit remained after landmark analysis was completed, with a median overall survival was 51.7 months in the PORT group versus 44.2 months in the no PORT group (adjusted HR 0.82, [95% CI = 0.71 to 0.93]; P < 0.005). Factors associated with receipt of PORT were facility location, Charlson‐Deyo comorbidity index and grade (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: Improved survival is associated with receipt of PORT for patients with N2 NSCLC treated with complete resection and multiagent chemotherapy. Evidence from randomized trials should better delineate the role of PORT in this patient population.","['Herskovic, A', 'Christos, P', 'Mauer, E', 'Nagar, H']",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.176
Comparison of the efficacy of radiotherapy between postoperative mediastinal lymph node recurrence and stage III disease in non-small cell lung cancer patients,"Purpose: It is unknown if local treatment is equally effective in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with postoperative mediastinal lymph node recurrence or primary stage III disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, in patients with postoperative mediastinal lymph node recurrence. Methods: Patient characteristics, treatment response and survival were compared between NSCLC patients with mediastinal lymph node metastases treated between 2002‐2009 by radiotherapy alone or by chemoradiotherapy (group A, N=33) and those with primary stage III disease (group B, N = 157). Results: Men accounted for 60.6% of group A and 78.9% of group B (p=0.04 patients). ECOG performance status 0 was detected in 78.7% of group A and 57.3% of group B (p=0.02). The response rates in groups A and B were 66.6 and 72.3%, respectively (p=0.64). Progression‐free survival (PFS) was similar between groups A and B (median 15.0 vs 11.0 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.78; 95% CI 0.51‐1.20; p=0.26). However, overall survival (OS) was better in group A than in group B (median 67.0 vs 39.0 months; HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.29‐0.97; p=0.03). Postoperative PFS (median 12.5 vs 19.0 months; HR 1.50; 95% CI 0.64‐3.49; p=0.34) and OS (median, 67.0 vs 60.0 months; HR 1.22; 95% CI 0.36‐4.14; p=0.74) were similar between the group A treatments (radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy, respectively).

"A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Phase 3 Noninferiority Study of Darbepoetin Alfa for Anemia in Advanced NSCLC","Background: The effect of erythropoiesis‐stimulating agents on overall survival (OS) in patients with chemotherapy‐induced anemia has long been debated. This study (NCT00858364) evaluated noninferiority of darbepoetin alfa (DAR) versus placebo for OS and progression‐free survival (PFS) in anemic patients with NSCLC treated to a 12.0‐g/dL hemoglobin ceiling. Method: Adults with stage IV NSCLC expected to receive ≥2 cycles of myelosuppressive chemotherapy, life expectancy >6 months, ECOG 0–1, and hemoglobin ≤11.0 g/dL were randomized 2:1 to DAR (500 μg SC) or placebo Q3W. Patients were stratified by region, histology, and hemoglobin. Primary endpoint was OS; a Cox proportional hazards model, stratified by randomization factors, was used to evaluate noninferiority (margin based on upper confidence limit [CL] for hazard ratio [HR] ˂1.15). Secondary endpoints were PFS (noninferiority) and incidence of transfusions or hemoglobin ≤8.0 g/dL from week 5 to end of efficacy treatment period (EOETP). Result: 4161 patients were screened, 2549 enrolled, and 2516 included in the primary analysis set: 1680 randomized to DAR and 836 to placebo. The study was stopped early per independent DMC recommendation. Patients were well matched between arms for age (mean 61.8 years), sex (66.0% male), and race (47.5% white). DAR was noninferior to placebo for OS (HRadj 0.92; 95%CL 0.83–1.01) and PFS (HRadj 0.95; 95%CL 0.87–1.04). DAR was superior to placebo for transfusion or hemoglobin ≤8.0 g/dL from week 5 to EOETP (OR 0.70; 95%CL 0.57–0.86; P<0.001). Objective tumor response was similar between arms (DAR 36.2%; placebo 32.6%). Incidence of serious adverse events was the same in both arms (31.1%). No unexpected adverse events or cases of antibody‐mediated PRCA were observed (Table). Conclusion: DAR dosed to a 12.0‐g/dL hemoglobin ceiling was noninferior to placebo for OS and PFS and significantly reduced odds of transfusion or hemoglobin ≤8.0 g/dL in anemic patients with NSCLC receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy.

Predictive impact of different exon 19 deletions in EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with first-line TKIs,"Background: Common Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations in non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) predict sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine‐kinase inhibitors (TKIs), with exon 19 deletions being associated with better outcome when compared to L858R mutations. We aimed to investigate the impact of different exon 19 deletions on patient outcome in EGFR‐mutant NSCLC treated with first‐line TKIs. Methods: In this retrospective analysis we included 98 patients with metastatic NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletions, treated with first‐line EGFR TKIs (gefitinib or afatinib) in 3 Italian centers between 2011 and 2016. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), the secondary endpoint progression free survival (PFS). Analyses were performed by grouping exon 19 deletions according to two different models: type of deletion (delE746‐A750 vs other) and starting codon of deletion (E746 vs L747). Kaplan‐Meier method, the log‐rank test and multivariate Cox regression models were used to estimate survival outcomes. Median follow‐up time was 40 months. Results: All groups resulted well balanced in terms of patients' characteristics but the percentage of patients treated with gefitinib was significantly superior in E746 group compared to L747 (p = 0.02). In the whole cohort median OS was 24.6 months [95%CI 21.9 ‐ 33.1] while median PFS was 13.7 months [95%CI 11.6 ‐ 15.9]. When delE746‐A750 (n = 60) was compared to the other deletions in exon 19 (n = 38), no differences were evidenced either in terms of OS (24.1 vs 26.0 months; HR 0.80 [95%CI 0.5 ‐ 1.4]; p = 0.42) or PFS (13.9 vs. 12.8 months; HR 0.99 [95%CI 0.6 ‐ 1.6]; p = 0.97). Similarly, no difference in OS or PFS emerged comparing E746 (n = 73) versus L747 group (n = 25) (OS:24.6 and 26.0 months, respectively, HR 0.79 [95%CI 0.4 ‐ 1.4; p = 0.45; PFS 13.9 vs 12.9 months, respectively (HR 0.87 [95%CI 0.5 ‐ 1.4] p = 0.57). On multivariate analysis including age, sex, smoking history, deletions (delE746‐A750 vs others or E746 vs L747), presence of brain metastases at diagnosis or during TKI treatment, no variable resulted associated with longer OS or PFS. Conclusions: Different exon 19 deletions are equally sensitive to first‐line EGFR TKIs in EGFR‐mutant NSCLC.","['Rossi, S', 'Toschi, L', 'Finocchiaro, G', ""D'Argento, E"", 'Di Noia, VP', 'Cassano, A', 'Bonomi, M', 'Cerchiaro, E', 'Ceresoli, GL', 'Beretta, GD', 'et al.']",
1659P Immune checkpoint inhibitors plus VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors as second-line or later therapy for patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer,"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have greatly changed the current treatment status of extensive‐stage small‐cell lung cancer (ES‐SCLC) and are approved to be used in the first‐line setting of ES‐SCLC. However. treatment choices in second line or above in ES‐SCLC setting remains limited. Hence, the present retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ICIs plus anti‐VEGF/VEGFR agents in ES‐SCLC patients in the second line or later setting, and preliminarily explore the predictive value of neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in ES‐SCLC. Methods: Patients with ES‐SCLC who have received anti‐PD‐1/PD‐L1‐based therapy between 2019 and 2020 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively screened. The progression‐free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were estimated. The correlation between NLR and the response of the combined regimen was evaluated. Results: 35 patients were ultimately included in the present study. All of them were administered with ICIs plus anti‐angiogenesis agents in the second line or later setting. confirmed ORR was 17.6.0% (95%CI: 4.1%‐31.1%), the DCR reached 47.1% (95%CI:29.4%‐64.7%) the median PFS reached 8 months (95% CI: 3.5‐12.5). At the time of data cutoff, the median OS was not reached. In univariable logistic regression analysis, patients with NLR greater than or equal to 5 were associated with poorer PFS compared with less than 5 (the median PFS 4 months vs 20.4 months, p=0.0174, HR=2.642, 95% CI: 0.94‐7.4). In addition, median OS in NLR≥5 group were also significantly shorter than that in NLR < 5 group (p=0.0198, HR=8.579, 95% CI: 1.31‐56.4). Additionally, the ORR was numerically higher in the NLR<5 group than that in the NLR≥5 group (21.7% [95% CI: 3.5‐40] vs 8.3% [95% CI: ‐10‐26.7], p=0.39). Conclusions: ICIs plus anti‐angiogenesis inhibitors show potential antitumor activity in second line or later settings in ED‐SCLC patients. And the current work indicated NLR could be a promising predictive marker for the response of the combined regimen. The data warrant confirmation by randomized clinical studies.

P2.26-02 Patient-Reported Symptom Monitoring Improves 1-Year Quality of Life in Lung Cancer Patients; the SYMPRO-Lung Trial,"Introduction: The use of patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) to monitor symptoms during and after cancer treatment can improve health‐related quality of life (HRQOL) and overall survival (OS), especially when linked to an alert system. Previous studies only used alerts that were sent to health care providers (HCP's), while an approach in which patients themselves receive alerts could be more clinically feasible. Within the SYMPRO‐Lung trial, we compared the potential differential effect of a reactive approach (patient receives alert) versus an active approach (HCP receives alert) on HRQOL after treatment. At 15 weeks, we showed that PRO symptom monitoring significantly improved HRQOL compared to care as usual with non‐inferiority between the active and the reactive approach. In this study, we report the effect of weekly PRO symptom monitoring on long‐term HRQOL at 6‐months and 1‐year after treatment. Methods: SYMPRO‐Lung is a Dutch multicenter randomized trial using a stepped wedge design. Inclusion criteria were:(non‐)small cell lung cancer, stage I‐IV, starting a new treatment. Patients in the intervention group weekly reported PRO symptoms using the PRO‐CTCAE lung cancer subset. If symptoms exceeded a validated threshold, an alert was sent. HRQOL was measured by the EORTC QLQ‐C30 at baseline, 15 weeks, 6 months and 1 year after start of treatment. Physical functioning (PF) and the Summary Score (SS) were included as primary endpoints. Linear mixed‐effects modeling was used to assess mean differences over time and at each time point, accounting for confounding. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated in which 0.40 being considered clinically relevant. Clinically meaningful within‐patient changes were defined as improvement or deterioration of < 5 points. Results: In total, 515 patients were included in the study (266 in the control group, 249 in the intervention group). In the intervention group, 244 patients completed 6836 symptom checklists during 1 year of follow‐up, with a mean of 28 per patient (SD 17.5). A total of 1308 alerts (19%) were triggered, i.e. a mean of 5 per patient (SD 4.8). No significant differences were found between the reactive and active intervention groups on SS (6‐months B1.45, 95%CI ‐2.33 ‐ 5.22, ES 0.09; 1‐year B2.11, 95%CI ‐1.88 ‐ 6.10, ES 0.13) and PF (6‐months B‐4.60, 95%CI ‐9.76 ‐ 0.56, ES 0.22; 1‐year B‐1.85, 95%CI ‐7.30 ‐ 3.59, ES 0.09). The pooled intervention groups had a significantly better SS (6‐months B6.28, 95%CI 3.65 ‐ 8.92, ES 0.40; 1‐year B3.97, 95%CI 1.15 ‐ 6.80, ES 0.25), compared to the control group. PF did not reach clinical relevant ES (6‐months B6.79, 95%CI 3.26 ‐ 10.31, ES 0.26; 1‐year B5.01, 95% CI 1.23 ‐ 8.79, ES0.19). More clinically meaningful within‐patient changes were observed in the intervention group (SS 41% vs. 36% improved and 25% vs. 41% deteriorated, p=0.010, PF 39% vs. 26% improved and 36% vs. 51% deteriorated, p=0.023) than the control group. Conclusions: PRO symptom monitoring significantly improves long‐term HRQOL in lung cancer patients. The logistically less intensive approach of sending alerts to patients still appears to be equally effective as the active approach on 1‐year HRQOL benefit.

Overall Survival of Patients with Early-Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treated Daily Versus Non-Daily with Lung Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy,"Purpose/Objective(s): Data is conflicting with regard to the influence of consecutive (daily) treatment on toxicity and even local control in patients with non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with lung stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Small retrospective studies suggest worse toxicity and local control with daily treatment while others have found no difference in outcomes. Large national databases may have sufficient statistical power to discern differences in survival outcomes between these two treatment regimens. Materials/Methods: We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to identify patients with stage I or II NSCLC treated with primary radiation therapy. We included only patients treated in 3‐5 fractions with a biologically effective dose (BED) of ≥ 100 Gy. Daily treatment was considered to be treatment within 6 or 7 days for 4‐ and 5‐fraction regimens, respectively, to account for a potential weekend treatment break. Daily treatment was considered to be treatment within 3 days for 3‐fraction regimens. We used 1:1 nearest neighbor propensity score matching (caliper 0.1) to balance daily and non‐daily cohorts on the basis of age, race, sex, treatment facility type, education, income, insurance status, county population, distance from treatment center, Charlson comorbidity index, tumor laterality, T‐stage, histology, radiation dose, and year of diagnosis. Cox regression and Kaplan‐Meier analysis were used to assess the association of daily treatment with overall survival. Results: We identified 40,161 patients, 11,168 (27.8%) of which were treated with daily treatments. Daily treatment was associated with a higher proportion of Caucasians (90.6% vs 88.7%, p < 0.001), Charlson comorbidity index of 0‐2 (95% vs 93.1%; p < 0.001), treatment at an academic medical center (41.9% vs 39.1%; p < 0.001), and increased distance to treatment facility (12.6 vs 10.8 miles; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences in age or sex. After propensity‐score matching, there were 7176, 6402, and 4176 patients treated with 5, 4, and 3 fraction regimens, respectively. There were no significant differences in any of the variables. For 5‐fraction regimens, there was no statistically significant difference in overall survival with non‐daily vs daily treatment (HR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.00 – 1.13). Non‐daily treatment was associated with improved overall survival for 4‐fraction (HR = 0.93; 95% CI 0.88 – 0.995; p = 0.033) and 3‐fraction (HR = 0.91; 95% CI 0.85 – 0.98; p = 0.018) regimens. Conclusion: We found improved overall survival in patients treated with non‐daily fractions when treated with 3‐ or 4‐fraction regimes. We found no significant difference in overall survival in patients treated with 5‐fraction regimens. Altering fractionation scheme may be a simple means of improving outcomes in lung SBRT. More data is warranted on the effects of altering fractionation on tumor control outcomes, and these data should be considered to be validated in the context of a prospective randomized trial.","['Sebastian, N', 'Brownstein, JM', 'Welliver, MX', 'Haglund, KE', 'Williams, TM']",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.07.1184
INVESTIGATING NAVIGATION TO HELP ADVANCE LUNG EQUITY (INHALE): a PRAGMATIC TRIAL OF PATIENT NAVIGATION FOR LUNG CANCER SCREENING AT A HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS PROGRAM,"BACKGROUND: People experiencing homelessness die of lung cancer at over 2‐fold higher rates than people in the general population. Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces lung cancer mortality among those at increased risk, but the circumstances of homelessness create multiple barriers to LCS LDCT completion. Patient navigation is a promising but untested strategy for overcoming these barriers in a homeless‐experienced patient population. METHODS: In 2020‐2022, we conducted a pragmatic trial of LCS patient navigation at a large urban Health Care for the Homeless (HCH) program. To be eligible, participants were required to have a history of homelessness, have a primary care provider (PCP) at the HCH program, be proficient in English, and meet the 2015‐2022 Medicare LCS coverage criteria: 55‐77 years old, 30 pack‐year smoking history, and smoking within the past 15 years. Enrolled participants completed a baseline survey and were randomized 2:1 to usual care with or without LCS navigation. Following a theory‐based, patient‐centered protocol, the navigator provided lung cancer education, facilitated LCS shared decision‐making visits with PCPs, assisted in making and attending LCS LDCT appointments, arranged follow‐up when needed, and offered tobacco cessation support for current smokers. The primary outcome was receipt of LCS LDCT at 6 months, ascertained by medical records review and compared between study arms with the Chi square test. Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods approach, qualitative interviews assessed participants' perceptions of the navigation intervention. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty participants were randomized to usual care with (n=173) or without (n=87) LCS navigation. The mean age was 60.5 years, 70.8% were male, 36.9% were Black, 36.9% were white, and 14.6% were Hispanic. One‐third of participants (32.3%) were currently homeless, and 67.7% were formerly homeless (23.5% precariously housed, 43.1% stably housed). Half (50.8%) reported fair or poor health, and 85.0% currently smoked. Serious mental illness (28.8%), at‐risk drug use (27.7%), and at‐risk alcohol use (23.5%) were common. At 6 months, 43.4% of navigation arm participants and 9.2% of usual care arm participants had completed LCS LDCT (p<0.001). The intervention effect did not differ by housing status (p=0.68); however, across both study arms, housed individuals had higher LCS completion rates than currently homeless individuals in unadjusted (37.5% vs. 20.2%) and multivariable adjusted (aOR 3.52, 95% CI 1.57, 7.88) analyses. In qualitative interviews, participants identified multiple types of social support provided by the navigator, including informational, emotional, instrumental, and affirmational support CONCLUSIONS: Patient navigation produced a nearly 5‐fold increase in LCS completion at a large HCH organization. Even with individualized navigation support, housing status remained a major determinant of study outcomes.","['Baggett, TP', 'Sporn, N', 'Teixeira, JB', 'Rodriguez, EC', 'Anandakugan, N', 'Critchley, N', 'Kennedy, E', 'Hart, K', 'Joyce, A', 'Chang, Y', 'et al.']",10.1007/s11606-023-08226-z
"Dacomitinib Versus Gefitinib For The First-Line Treatment of Advanced EGFR Mutation Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (ARCHER 1050): a Randomized, Open- Label Phase III Trial","Background: Dacomitinib is a 2nd generation EGFR TKI with encouraging clinical activity as 1st‐line therapy in patients with EGFR‐activating mutation positive advanced NSCLC (Jänne, Lancet Oncol 2014).

Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as an important prognostic marker in stage III locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer: confirmatory results from the PROCLAIM phase III clinical trial,"Background: Neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an important pretreatment marker of systemic inflammation and tumor aggressiveness. Increased levels of this ratio have been associated with reduced survival in several observational studies of lung cancer. However, supporting analyses from large clinical trial data are lacking. Methods: To validate the prognostic role of NLR, the current study evaluated data from a randomized phase III study (PROCLAIM; clinicaltrial.gov ID: NCT00686959) of patients with stage IIIA/B, unresectable, non‐squamous, non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), originally comparing combination pemetrexed‐cisplatin chemoradiotherapy with etoposide‐cisplatin chemoradiotherapy. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for survival were estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Models were adjusted for age, race, sex, stage, treatment, and body mass index (BMI). Patients were followed for a median of 24 months. Results: Increased NLR levels at baseline were associated with reduced overall (PTrend <0.0001) and progression‐free survival (PTrend <0.005). A similar but decreasing linear trend was not observed for lymphocytes count alone. Conclusions: These findings provide substantiating evidence that NLR, which is routinely available from standard blood testing of patients diagnosed with NSCLC, is an important inflammation‐based prognostic marker for survival among patients with locally advanced disease undergoing chemoradiation. Future research will benefit by assessing the prognostic potential of NLR in the context of genetic mutations and molecular markers.","['Biswas, T', 'Gawdi, R', 'Jindal, C', 'Iyer, S', 'Kang, KH', 'Bajor, D', 'Machtay, M', 'Choi, YM', 'Efird, JT']",10.21037/jtd-21-1018
Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) in Early Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: a National Cancer Database (NCDB) Propensity Matched Analysis Comparing Survival in Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"Purpose/Objective(s): Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) is a noninvasive treatment strategy and the current standard of care for inoperable early stage non‐small cell lung cancer (ES‐NSCLC). NSCLC is a diverse group of malignancies with the predominant histologic subtypes of adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Several retrospective analyses have demonstrated an association between SCC and increased rates of local failure following SABR. However, these previous investigations have shown incongruent results in regard to the histologic association of SCC with reduced overall survival. Therefore, we analyzed the national cancer database (NCDB) to compare overall survival in ES‐NSCLC patients with ADC and SCC subtypes treated with SABR. Materials/Methods: We queried the NCDB for ES‐NSCLC (T1‐2N0, Stage I‐IIA) patients with pathologically confirmed SCC or ADC between the years 2004 – 2015 treated with 1‐5 fractions of SABR to ablative doses (Biologically effective dose ≥ 100 Gy10) in this IRB‐exempt study. Univariable and multivariable analyses identified characteristics predictive of overall survival. Overall survival (OS) was calculated from the date of diagnosis to the date of last contact or death using Kaplan Meier curves to present the cumulative probability of survival, and log‐rank statistics were used to assess statistical significance between groups. A propensity score analysis was used to account for any indication bias between the two histologic arms. Results: Ultimately 15,310 ES‐NSCLC patients with either ADC (n=9,009) or SCC (n=6,301) were eligible for analysis. Univariable analysis demonstrated a median overall survival of 44 months and 33 months (p<0.0001) and 5‐year overall survival of 36% and 24% (p<0.0001) in patients diagnosed with ADC and SCC, respectively. Patients with ADC were less likely to have T2 lesions (OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.64‐0.75, p<0.0001) and poorly differentiated grade (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.42‐0.51, p<0.0001). White race, male sex, T1 lesions, and age <75 years were also associated with improved survival. Patients with SCC still had worse survival on propensity score matched multivariable comparison (p<0.0001). Conclusion: Our NCDB‐based study is the largest known analysis examining the association between histology (SCC vs ADC) and survival outcomes in patients with ES‐NSCLC treated with SABR. Both median and 5‐year overall survival was inferior in patients with SCC, corroborating the results of previous studies. Randomized, prospective studies are needed to further validate these findings and potentially identify treatment strategies that may improve outcomes in this histologic subset. Author Disclosure: S.

Updated efficacy and safety from the phase 3 CROWN study of first-line lorlatinib vs crizotinib in advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"Background: Lorlatinib improved progression‐free survival (PFS) and demonstrated intracranial (IC) activity in patients (pts) with untreated advanced ALK+ NSCLC in the interim analysis of the randomized, Phase 3, CROWN study of lorlatinib vs crizotinib. We report updated 36‐month followup data. Methods: 296 pts with previously untreated advanced ALK+ NSCLC were randomized 1:1 to oral lorlatinib (100 mg QD; n=149) or crizotinib (250 mg BID; n=147), stratified by presence of CNS metastases (mets) and ethnicity. Primary endpoint: PFS by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included overall survival, PFS by investigator, and objective response (OR), IC‐OR, IC time to progression (IC‐TTP), duration of response (DR), IC‐DR (all by BICR), and safety. Results: At data cutoff (Sep 20, 2021), median duration of follow‐up for PFS was 36.7 months for lorlatinib and 29.3 months for crizotinib. Median PFS by BICR was NR (95% CI, NR‐NR) for lorlatinib and 9.3 months (95% CI, 7.6‐11.1) for crizotinib (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.18‐0.39). PFS by investigator results were similar (Table). For pts with brain mets at baseline (n=37 lorlatinib/n=39 crizotinib), the HR for IC‐TTP for lorlatinib vs crizotinib was 0.10 (95% CI, 0.04‐0.27), and for pts without brain mets (n=112/n=108) was 0.02 (95% CI, 0.002‐0.14). OR, IC‐OR, DR, and IC‐DR were all improved with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (Table). All‐cause grade 3‐4 adverse events (AEs) and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were reported in 76% and 7% of pts with lorlatinib and 57% and 10% of pts with crizotinib, respectively. No new safety signals emerged. Conclusions: These updated long‐term data from CROWN confirm the efficacy of lorlatinib over crizotinib in pts with treatment‐naïve ALK+ NSCLC, with no new safety signals detected, and support the use of lorlatinib in pts with untreated ALK+ NSCLC with and without brain mets.

Predictive factors for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor retreatment in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer - A multicenter retrospective SEQUENCE study,"Background Acquired resistance occurs in most non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations experiencing a response to EGFR‐tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) initially. We investigated EGFR‐TKI retreatment in patients who had previously received EGFR‐TKI followed by chemotherapy. Materials and methods This was a retrospective multicenter study. Patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma or TTF‐1 (+) NSCLC, positive EGFR sensitive mutation, and EGFR‐TKI reuse after initial EGFR‐TKI followed by chemotherapy were enrolled. The objectives were to assess the objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression‐free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of EGFR TKI switched retreatment. Results In total, 205 patients were enrolled, with a median age of 61.8 years (range 31.4‐92.9). There was a larger proportion of females (62.9%) than males, and more never‐smokers (73.2%) than ever‐smokers. In the initial EGFR‐TKI administration, 57.6% of patients showed a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), and 34.6% had stable disease (SD); in the second‐line chemotherapy, 13.7% had PR, and 58.0% had SD; in the EGFR‐TKI retreatment, 7.3% had PR, and 37.1% had SD. The median PFS of first‐line EGFR‐TKI was 8.0 months (95% CI 7.3‐8.2), and retreatment EGFR‐TKI was 4.1 months (95% CI 2.7‐4.6). The median OS since the start of the first‐line EGFR‐TKI therapy was 35.9 months (95% CI 28.8‐50.9), and since the start of EGFR‐TKI retreatment was 12.6 months (95% CI 10.4‐20.9). In the univariable and multivariable regression analysis of factors associated with PFS of EGFR‐TKI retreatment, time interval between the two EGFR TKIs equal to or more than 7 months was statistically significant (HR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.44‐0.86; HR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.43‐0.86), both p < 0.01. Females with exon 21 mutation also showed a significant difference between the two groups (HR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.30‐0.86; HR = 0.52 (0.31‐0.88), both p < 0.05). Conclusions EGFR‐TKI retreatment was effective in prolonging survival, and was shown to be a worthwhile option for EGFR‐mutated NSCLC patients after failure of first‐line EGFR‐TKI and chemotherapy. The survival benefit was especially pronounced in patients with longer drug holidays from the initial EGFR‐TKI and in females with the exon 21 mutation.

LBA2 ALINA: efficacy and safety of adjuvant alectinib versus chemotherapy in patients with early-stage ALK+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"Background: For patients (pts) with resected, stage IB–IIIA, ALK+ NSCLC, the recommended treatment after surgery is platinum‐based chemotherapy (CT), which is associated with modest improvements in survival. In advanced ALK+ NSCLC, alectinib is a preferred first‐line treatment. Here, we report data from the prespecified interim analysis of ALINA (NCT03456076), a global, phase III, open‐label, randomised trial assessing the efficacy and safety of adjuvant alectinib compared with CT in pts with completely resected ALK+ NSCLC. Methods: Eligible pts were ≥18 years old, had an ECOG PS of 0/1 and completely resected, stage IB (≥4 cm)–IIIA, ALK+ NSCLC (per UICC/AJCC 7th edition). Pts were randomised 1:1 to receive either oral alectinib 600 mg twice daily, or up to four 21‐day cycles of IV platinum‐based CT. Randomisation was stratified by stage (IB vs II vs IIIA) and race (Asian vs non‐Asian). Alectinib was given for up to 24 months or until disease recurrence, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Primary endpoint: investigator‐assessed disease‐free survival (DFS), tested hierarchically first in the stage II–IIIA and then in the ITT population (stage IB–IIIA). Other endpoints included: CNS‐DFS, overall survival (OS), safety. Results: A total of 257 pts were randomised to receive alectinib (n=130) or CT (n=127); baseline characteristics were overall well balanced between arms. At data cutoff (26 June 2023), median follow up was 27.8 months. A significant DFS benefit was observed with alectinib vs CT in both the stage II–IIIA (HR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.13–0.45) and ITT populations (HR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.13–0.43; Table). A clinically meaningful CNS‐DFS benefit was observed in the ITT population (HR 0.22; 95% CI 0.08–0.58). OS data were immature. No unexpected safety findings were observed. Conclusions: Alectinib is the first ALK inhibitor to significantly improve DFS compared with CT and provides an effective new treatment strategy for pts with resected ALK+ NSCLC.

Long term follow-up on NRG oncology RTOG 0915 (NCCTG N0927): a randomized phase II study of 2 SBRT schedules for lung cancer,"Background: NRG Oncology RTOG 0915/NCCTG N0927 was a randomized lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) trial of 34 Gy in 1 fraction (arm 1) versus 48 Gy in 4 fractions (arm 2) designed to select the better of the 2 regimens by comparing them at 1 year (yr): first by rates of pre‐specified protocol‐specified adverse events (psAEs), then by primary tumor control for each arm. 34 Gy emerged as the least toxic yet equally efficacious regimen. Herein, we update those results with long‐term follow‐up. Method: This phase II North American multicenter study of patients aged 18 yrs or older with medically inoperable non‐small cell lung cancer with biopsy‐proven peripheral (≥2 cm from the central bronchial tree) T1 or T2, N0 (clinically node negative by positron emission tomography), M0 tumors was designed to detect 1‐yr psAEs rates >17% as primary endpoint. Primary tumor failure (PTF) (either infield or marginal failure) and local failure (either infield, marginal, or involved lobe failure) [with death without failure considered as a competing event]; overall survival (OS); disease‐free survival (DFS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were secondary endpoints, but the study was not designed for statistical comparisons of these outcomes. The study opened in September 2009 and closed in March 2011. Updated data were analyzed through November 14, 2016. Result: Ninety four patients were accrued, with 86 eligible for analysis: 41 in arm 1 and 45 in arm 2, after 8 cases were excluded. Median follow‐up time was 3.8 yrs for all patients, and 5.1 yrs for those alive at analysis. The grade 3 and higher treatment‐related toxicity profile was unchanged since previous report, with specifically no new high grade chest wall or grade 5 events. Four of 48 Gy patients had subsequent grade 3 changes in spirometry since meeting the primary endpoint. Medians (in yrs) for 34 Gy and 48 Gy were: 4.1 vs. 4.0 for OS, and 2.6 vs. 2.8 for DFS, respectively. Five‐yr outcomes as % (95% CI) for 34 Gy and 48 Gy were: PTF rate of 7.9 (2.0, 19.5) vs. 6.8 (1.7, 16.9); OS of 28.8 (15.4, 43.8) vs. 40.2 (24.9, 55.0); PFS of 19.1 (8.5, 33.0) vs. 31.8 (18.6, 45.9); and second primary rate of 15.5 (6.1, 28.9) vs. 13.3 (5.3, 25.1), respectively. Distant failure as the sole failure or a component of first failure was numerically higher in the 34 Gy arm (7 (46.7%)), but in the 48 Gy arm, rate of second primary development was higher (7 (43.8%)). Approximately 1/3 of patients' causes of death was unknown, and another 1/3 was related to causes other than cancer or treatment. Conclusion: No excess in lateappearing toxicity was seen in either arm. Primary tumor control rates at 5 yrs were similar by arm. Median survival times of 4 yrs for each arm suggest similar efficacy pending any larger studies appropriately powered to detect survival differences.","['Videtic, G', 'Paulus, R', 'Singh, A', 'Chang, J', 'Parker, W', 'Olivier, K', 'Timmerman, R', 'Komaki, R', 'Urbanic, J', 'Stephans, K', 'et al.']",
"Dacomitinib versus gefftinib for the first-line treatment of advanced egfr mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer (ARCHER 1050): a randomized, open-label phase III trial","Background: Dacomitinib is a 2nd generation EGFR TKI with encouraging clinical activity as 1st‐line therapy in patients with EGFR‐activating mutation positive advanced NSCLC (Jänne, Lancet Oncol 2014). We performed the first randomized phase III trial, currently ongoing, comparing dacomitinib (D) with gefftinib (G) as 1st‐line therapy (1L) (NCT01774721). Methods: Patients (pts) with newly diagnosed stage IIIB/IV/ recurrent NSCLC harboring an EGFR‐ activating mutation (exon 19 del or exon 21 L858R mu +/‐ exon 20 T790M mu) were randomized 1:1 to D 45 mg PO QD or G 250mg PO QD; stratification was by race and EGFR mutation subtype. The primary endpoint was PFS per blinded independent review (IRC) analyzed by Kaplan‐Meier method with log‐rank test and Cox model. Secondary endpoints included: overall survival, objective response rate (ORR), duration of response (DR), PFS per Investigator (INV), time to treatment failure (TTF), restricted mean survival time (RMST) for PFS, safety and patient‐reported outcomes (PROs). Results: The ITT population included 452 pts with baseline characteristics fairly well balanced between the arms. ORR per IRC was similar between arms (75% [95% CI: 69, 80] for D and 72% [95% CI: 65, 77]; 2‐sided p‐value = 0.39; OS is not mature. The most commonly reported grade 3 adverse events with dacomitinib were dermatitis acneiform (13.7%) and diarrhea (8.4%) and with gefftinib ALT (8.5%); no new safety signals were identified. Conclusions: ARCHER 1050 was the first phase III head‐to‐head study of EGFR TKIs and demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in efficacy of D vs. G in 1L NSCLC pts with EGFR‐activating mutations with a manageable safety profile, to offer a new 1L treatment option.

Lorlatinib vs crizotinib in the first-line treatment of patients (pts) with advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): results of the phase III CROWN study,"Background: Lorlatinib, a 3rd generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor has shown overall and intracranial (IC) activity in advanced ALK+ NSCLC. We report interim data from an open label randomized, multicenter, phase III study of lorlatinib vs crizotinib in pts with untreated ALK+ NSCLC (NCT03052608). Methods: Untreated pts with ALK+ Stage IIIB/IV NSCLC (104 study sites; 23 countries) were randomized 1:1 to oral lorlatinib (100 mg QD) or crizotinib (250 mg BID); stratified by presence of CNS metastases and ethnicity. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival (PFS) by blinded independent central review (BICR). PFS by investigator (INV), objective response (OR) and IC‐OR by BICR, duration of response (DR), IC‐DR, overall survival (OS) and safety were secondary endpoints. This planned interim analysis was conducted at 72% of 177 expected PFS events. Results: Of 296 pts randomized, 291 received study treatment. At data cutoff (20 March 2020), median follow‐up for PFS by BICR was 18.3 months (95% CI 16.4, 20.1) for lorlatinib (n=149) and 14.8 months (95% CI 12.8, 18.4) for crizotinib (n=147). PFS by BICR was significantly prolonged with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.191, 0.413; stratified 1‐sided p<0.001). Lorlatinib median PFS was NE (not estimable) (95% CI NE, NE) vs crizotinib 9.3 months (95% CI 7.6, 11.1). PFS by INV, OR and IC‐OR by BICR were improved with lorlatinib vs crizotinib (Table). Grade 3–4 adverse events (AE)/AEs leading to treatment discontinuation: 72.5%/6.7% for lorlatinib; 55.6%/9.2% for crizotinib. The majority of Grade 3–4 AEs for lorlatinib were laboratory abnormalities, the most common of which were lipid abnormalities. [Formula presented] Conclusions: Lorlatinib resulted in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in PFS vs crizotinib and should be considered a new first‐line treatment option for pts with ALK+ NSCLC.

OA02.04 Randomized Phase Ⅱ Trial (RTOG1106) on Midtreatment PET/CT Guided Adaptive Radiotherapy in Locally Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Introduction: Dose‐intensified radiation has been shown to improve tumor control and survival in Stage I NSCLC, and in Stage III NSCLC radiation‐alone studies. However, NRG‐RTOG 0617 showed that with concurrent chemo‐RT, higher‐dose RT paradoxically worsened survival. Here we present the results of a multicenter trial led by NRG Oncology and American College of Radiology Network (ACRIN), which aimed to determine whether adaptive isotoxic radiation dose escalation to mid‐treatment FDG‐PET provides superior local tumor control compared to a standard uniform dose of 60 Gy in patients with stage III NSCLC. Methods: Patients with stage III NSCLC medically fit for concurrent chemoradiation were randomized by a 1:2 ratio to standard (60Gy) arm and adaptive therapy arm (dose individualized to 20 Gy MLD and adapted to residual tumor on the mid‐treatment FDG‐PET/CT). All patients had FDG‐PET performed around 40 Gy mid‐treatment and RT was delivered in 30 daily fractions. The adaptive arm consisted of an initial plan of 2.2 Gy/Fx for 21 Fx followed by an adaptive RT boost to mid‐treatment FDG‐PET target using a variable prescription of 2.2‐3.8 Gy/Fx for the final 9 Fx. The primary endpoint of this report was 2‐year Local‐Regional tumor Progression Free (LRPF), with inclusion of overall and in‐field LRPF, assessed independently and blindly by ACRIN radiologists. Results: Of 138 patients enrolled between February 2012 and March 2017, 127 were eligible and analyzable, with 43 and 84 patients in the standard and adaptive arms, with a minimum follow‐up of 3.7 and 3.4 years for surviving patients, respectively. The baseline characteristics, including age, gender, race, performance status, tumor size, histology, and stage, were balanced between the two arms. The median prescription dose for the adaptive arm was 71 Gy (Q1‐Q3 68‐76 Gy) vs. 60 Gy in the standard arm (P<0.01). The overall RT protocol compliance rates were Acceptable in 92.9% and 95.8%, Per Protocol in 50.0% and 32.4%, of standard and adaptive RT arms, respectively. There were no significant differences in lung, esophagus and heart toxicities, though the adaptive arm had numerically higher mean doses of these organs at risk. The 2‐year overall LRPF rates were 59.5% (95% CI: 37.9, 75.7) on the standard arm, and 54.6% (95% CI: 39.9, 67.0) on the adaptive arm. The median LRPF time was 27.5 months (95% CI: 14.3, not reached) on the standard arm and 28.4 months (95% CI: 19.1, not reached) on the adaptive arm. There were no significant differences in overall survival, progression free survival or lung cancer specific survival between the two arms. Correlative analyses, including radiation sensitivity genotyping, doses to lymphocytes and in‐field LRPF, are planned and results will be presented. Conclusion: This is the first randomized trial that demonstrated the feasibility and safety of performing biologically adaptive RT escalation in a multicenter setting in patients with stage III NSCLC. This preliminary analysis did not show an improvement in overall local regional tumor control. The in‐field local regional tumor control results are awaited.

Novel Non-Invasive Radiomic Signature on CT Scans Predicts Response to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy and Is Prognostic of Overall Survival in Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Background: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy characterized by initial chemosensitivity followed by resistance and rapid progression. Presently, there are no predictive biomarkers that can accurately guide the use of systemic therapy in SCLC patients. This study explores the role of radiomic features from both within and around the tumor lesion on pretreatment CT scans to a) prognosticate overall survival (OS) and b) predict response to chemotherapy. Methods: One hundred fifty‐three SCLC patients who had received chemotherapy were included. Lung tumors were contoured by an expert reader. The patients were divided randomly into approximately equally sized training (Str = 77) and test sets (Ste = 76). Textural descriptors were extracted from the nodule (intratumoral) and parenchymal regions surrounding the nodule (peritumoral). The clinical endpoints of this study were OS, progression‐free survival (PFS), and best objective response to chemotherapy. Patients with complete or partial response were defined as “responders,” and those with stable or progression of disease were defined as “non‐responders.” The radiomic risk score (RRS) was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) with the Cox regression model. Patients were classified into the high‐risk or low‐risk groups based on the median of RRS. Association of the radiomic signature with OS was evaluated on Str and then tested on Ste. The features identified by LASSO were then used to train a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier (MRad) to predict response to chemotherapy. A prognostic nomogram (NRad+Clin) was also developed on Str by combining clinical and prognostic radiomic features and validated on Ste. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and log‐rank statistical tests were performed to assess the discriminative ability of the features. The discrimination performance of the NRad+Clin was assessed by Harrell’s C‐index. To estimate the clinical utility of the nomogram, decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed by calculating the net benefits for a range of threshold probabilities in predicting which high‐risk patients should receive more aggressive treatment as compared with the low‐risk patients. Results: A univariable Cox regression analysis indicated that RRS was significantly associated with OS in Str (HR: 1.53; 95% CI, [1.1–2.2; p = 0.021]; C‐index = 0.72) and Ste (HR: 1.4, [1.1–1.82], p = 0.0127; C‐index = 0.69). The RRS was also significantly associated with PFS in Str (HR: 1.89, [1.4–4.61], p = 0.047; C‐index = 0.7) and Ste (HR: 1.641, [1.1–2.77], p = 0.04; C‐index = 0.67). MRad was able to predict response to chemotherapy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.76 ± 0.03 within Str and 0.72 within Ste. Predictors, including the RRS, gender, age, stage, and smoking status, were used in the prognostic nomogram.

"Randomised, placebo-controlled phase III trial of docetaxel plus carboplatin with or without levofloxacin prophylaxis in elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer: the APRONTA Trial","Objectives: Elderly patients receiving chemotherapy are more likely than younger patients to experience febrile neutropenia and infection. Prophy‐lactic fluoroquinolone administration during chemotherapy reduces the rate of febrile neutropenia, infection and hospitalisation vs placebo. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of levofloxacin prophylaxis on infection rates during chemotherapy with docetaxel plus carboplatin in elderly patients with advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: This was a randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled Phase III study. Patients aged (greater‐than or equal to)65 years with previously untreated, histologically/cytologically proven stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and normal cardiac, renal, hepatic and haematological function were included. Active infection or antibiotics 72 hours before inclusion was not permitted. Patients were randomised to receive docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenous [IV], Day 1) plus carboplatin (AUC 6 IV, Day 1) every 3 weeks, plus either placebo or levofloxacin (500 mg oral [po], once daily) on Days 5‐11. The primary endpoint was grade 3/4 infection rate or grade 1/2 infection rate with infection therapy. Results: Overall, 192 patients (median age 70 years; 80% male; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1/2 in 36%/55%/9%) were randomised to docetaxel plus carboplatin and either levofloxacin (n = 99) or placebo (n = 93); 5 patients received no treatment and were excluded from the ITT population. The rate of grade 3/4 infection was 27.5% (95% CI: 19.3‐39.0%) with levofloxacin vs 36.7% (95% CI: 27.1 48.0%) with placebo. Median time to first infection was 67 days for levofloxacin vs 46 days for placebo. The between‐group difference in median time to first infection was greater for patients aged over 70 years (69 vs 27 days for levofloxacin and placebo, respectively). Grade 3/4 infection occurred in 8% of patients receiving levofloxacin vs 26% of patients receiving placebo; there was one grade 5 infection in each group. Pneumonia and sepsis occurred in 12% and 1% of levofloxacin patients, respectively, vs 22% and 4% of the placebo group. Grade 3/4 mucositis, nausea and vomiting occurred in 5%, 3% and 3% of levofloxacin patients, respectively, vs 0%, 1% and 0% of placebo patients. Efficacy was similar in both groups. Conclusions: Levofloxacin prophylaxis is well tolerated in elderly patients receiving docetaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy and reduces the rate of infection compared with placebo.","['Dickgreber, N', 'Nagel, S', 'Roscher, K', 'Schuette, W']",
Activity of Crizotinib in MET or ROS1 Positive (+) NSCLC: results of the AcSe Trial,"Background: Crizotinib was registered for ALK+ NSCLC in 2013 and recently for ROS1+ stage IV NSCLC. To generate high evidenced‐based knowledge and to prevent off‐label use, the French National Cancer Institute (INCa) launched the AcSé Program: equal access to tumor molecular diagnosis including an exploratory phase II trial. AcSé allows nationwide safe and controlled access to crizotinib off‐label. Method: Biomarkers were identified with INCa molecular genetic platforms. Patients with amplification [amp] MET or mutation [mut] MET or translocation [tlc] ROS1 advanced NSCLC and not eligible for any other trial, were proposed crizotinib 250 mg BID. Tumor response was evaluated every 2 months (mo) using RECIST v1.1. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR) at 2 mo (complete + partiale response). A two‐stage Simon design was applied to each cohort. Median and 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated through Kaplan‐Meier for progression‐free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and response duration. Response duration was the delay between CR/PR and first progression/death or last follow‐up. Result: From 08/2013 to 03/2018, 5407 patients from 186 centers entered the biomarker program. Tumor alterations found in patients were: ROS1 tlc in 77/4050; MET amp (≥6 copies/diploid genome) in 251/4171; MET mut in 76/1007. Overall, 90 patients (median age, 63 years [30–92]) received crizotinib 250 mg BID. 73 grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) or SAE were reported in 70/90 patients. Grade ≥3 AEs were: hematologic toxicities (23%) including neutropenia (11%), and general disorders (16%) including fatigue (10%). Conclusion: This study confirms the excellent response rate of crizotinib in the ROS1+ population. Response rate in the MET mut population is comparable to the MET amp population. In addition, the response rate to crizotinib in the MET mut population is lower than that in the PROFILE 1001 study. The tolerance profile is good as previously reported.

Outcomes of anti-PD-(L)1 therapy with or without chemotherapy (chemo) for first-line (1L) treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with PD-L1 score ≥ 50%: FDA pooled analysis,"Background: FDA‐approved 1L treatment options for patients with PD‐L1‐high advanced NSCLC (PDL1 score ≥50%) include IO ± chemo (± anti‐angiogenics) but it is unclear if chemo substantially improves efficacy outcomes when added to IO in this patient population. Methods: Data was pooled from 12 randomized controlled trials that investigated anti‐PD‐(L)1 regimens ± chemo for the 1L treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. PD‐L1 score was defined as the proportion of tumor cells stained by the assay and analysis was conducted for patients with tumor PD‐L1 score ≥50%. OS, PFS, and ORR were compared between chemo‐IO and IO alone via a pooled analysis. Median survival times were estimated using Kaplan‐Meier methods. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by trial; odds ratios were estimated using a logistic regression model with trial as a covariate. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, race, ECOG, histology and smoking status. Results: A total of 3,189 patients with NSCLC and PD‐L1 score ≥50% were identified for this analysis. Baseline characteristics were: 38% ages 65‐74 years and 11% ages ≥75 years; 69% male; 80% White; 66% ECOG ≥1; and 89% former/current smokers. Median OS in the pooled chemo‐IO (N=455) and IO‐only (N=1,298) arms was 25.0 vs 20.9 months (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.08); median PFS was 9.6 vs 7.1 months, respectively (HR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.87). ORR was higher with chemo‐IO than with IO alone (61% vs 43%; Odds ratio 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.3). Conclusions: This exploratory, hypothesis‐generating pooled analysis suggests that most subgroups of patients with advanced NSCLC with PD‐L1 score ≥50% receiving FDA‐approved chemo‐IO regimens may have OS and PFS outcomes that are comparable with or better than IO‐only regimens. Patients ≥75 years of age receiving chemo‐IO may not have improved outcomes over IO. These results support shared decision‐making that balances potential benefits and risks of adding chemo to IO regimens based on patient factors that may impact tolerability.","['Akinboro, O', 'Vallejo, JJ', 'Nakajima, EC', 'Ren, Y', 'Mishra-Kalyani, PS', 'Larkins, EA', 'Vellanki, PJ', 'Drezner, NL', 'Mathieu, LN', 'Donoghue, MB', 'et al.']",10.1200/JCO.2022.40.16_suppl.9000
"Efficacy and a novel clinicopathologic-genomic nomogram of atezolizumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (POPLAR and OAK): a combined analysis of two multicenter, randomized, phase II/III trials","Background: Atezolizumab, a programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) inhibitor, prolonged overall survival (OS) compared with docetaxel among patients with previously treated advanced non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in two independent multicentre, randomized trials (POPLAR and OAK). We conducted a combined analysis of the two trials to evaluate its efficacy and genomic biomarkers, and to further developed a novel predictive clinicopathologic‐genomic nomogram of immunotherapy in NSCLC. Methods: Patients (N = 1,137) with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC and disease progression after previously platinum‐based chemotherapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive atezolizumab (1200 mg/kg every 3 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). The primary endpoint was OS. We applied a two‐stage meta‐analysis of pooled individual patient data in the intention‐to‐treat population. In OAK trial, patients treated with atezolizumab were randomly assigned (1:1) to the training group or the validation group to develop a predictive clinicopathologic‐genomic nomogram of immunotherapy. POPLAR and OAK were registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT02008227 and NCT01903993. Results: In the pooled analysis, the median overall survival was 13.49 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.95 to 15.22) with atezolizumab versus 9.66 months (95% CI, 8.73 to 10.70) with docetaxel. The risk of death was 28% lower with atezolizumab than with docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.83; P < 0.001). The race, sex, tumor histology, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status, PD‐L1 expression, and especially pretreatment mutation (TP53, DNMT3A and KEAP1) were significantly associated with OS, and were used for the development of the predictive nomogram. The clinical use of the nomogram showed a closer association with 3‐year OS than the blood‐based tumor mutational burden (bTMB) or PD‐L1 expression alone (nomogram, AUC = 0.818; bTMB, AUC = 0.701; PD‐L1, AUC = 0.526) among NSCLC patients who had received atezolizumab. The superior predictability of the nomogram was further confirmed in the validation and entire OAK cohorts. Conclusions: Among patients with advanced, previously treated NSCLC, OS was significantly better with atezolizumab than with docetaxel. Furthermore, we constructed a novel and powerful clinicopathologic‐genomic nomogram for personalized immunotherapy options.","['Yu, Y', 'Chen, Y', 'Li, A', 'Ou, Q', 'Wang, Y', 'Ren, W', 'Zhang, W', 'Tan, Y', 'Yao, H']",10.1200/JCO.2019.37.15-suppl.2573
Long-term follow-up on NRG oncology RTOG 0915 (NCCTG n0927): a randomized phase 2 study comparing 2 stereotactic body radiation therapy schedules for medically inoperable patients with stage i peripheral non-small cell lung cancer,"Purpose/Objective(s): NRG Oncology RTOG 0915/NCCTG N0927 was a randomized lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) trial of 34 Gy in 1 fraction (arm 1) versus 48 Gy in 4 fractions (arm 2) designed to select the better of the 2 regimens by comparing them at 1 year (yr): first by rates of pre‐specified protocol‐specified adverse events (psAEs), then by primary tumor control for each arm. Thirty‐four Gy emerged as the least toxic yet equally efficacious regimen. Herein, we update those results with long‐term follow‐up. Purpose/Objective(s): This phase II North American multicenter study of patients aged 18 yrs or older with medically inoperable non‐small cell lung cancer with biopsy‐proven peripheral (≥2 cm from the central bronchial tree) T1 or T2, N0 (clinically node negative by positron emission tomography), M0 tumors was designed to detect 1‐yr psAEs rates >17% as primary endpoint. Primary tumor failure (PTF) (either infield or marginal failure) and local failure (either infield, marginal, or involved lobe failure) [with death without failure considered as a competing event]; overall survival (OS); disease‐free survival (DFS) and progression‐free survival (PFS) were secondary endpoints, but the study was not designed for statistical comparisons of these outcomes. The study opened in September 2009 and closed in March 2011. Updated data were analyzed through November 14, 2016. Results: Ninety‐four patients were accrued, with 86 eligible for analysis: 41 in arm 1 and 45 in arm 2, after 8 cases were excluded. Median follow‐up time was 3.8 yrs for all patients, and 5.1 yrs for those alive at analysis. The grade 3 and higher treatment‐related toxicity profile was unchanged since previous report, with specifically no new high grade chest wall or grade 5 events. Four of 48 Gy patients had subsequent grade 3 changes in spirometry since meeting the primary endpoint. Medians (in yrs) for 34 Gy and 48 Gy were: 4.1 vs. 4.0 for OS, and 2.6 vs. 2.8 for DFS, respectively. Five‐yr outcomes as % (95% CI) for 34 Gy and 48 Gy were: PTF rate of 7.9 (2.0, 19.5) vs. 6.8 (1.7, 16.9); OS of 28.8 (15.4, 43.8) vs. 40.2 (24.9, 55.0); PFS of 19.1 (8.5, 33.0) vs. 31.8 (18.6, 45.9); and second primary rate of 15.5 (6.1, 28.9) vs. 13.3 (5.3, 25.1), respectively. Distant failure as the sole failure or a component of first failure was numerically higher in the 34 Gy arm (7 (46.7%)), but in the 48 Gy arm, rate of second primary development was higher (7 (43.8%)). Approximately 1/3 of patients' causes of death were unknown, and another 1/3 was related to causes other than cancer or treatment. Conclusion: No excess in late‐appearing toxicity was seen in either arm. Primary tumor control rates at 5 yrs were similar by arm. Median survivals of 4 yrs for each arm suggest similar efficacy pending any larger studies appropriately powered to detect survival differences.","['Videtic, GM', 'Paulus, R', 'Singh, AK', 'Chang, JY', 'Parker, W', 'Olivier, K', 'Timmerman, RD', 'Komaki, RU', 'Urbanic, JJ', 'Stephans, KL', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2017.06.052
1017P AdvanTIG-105: phase Ib dose-expansion study of ociperlimab (OCI) + tislelizumab (TIS) with chemotherapy (chemo) in patients (pts) with metastatic squamous (sq) and non-squamous (non-sq) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"Background: T‐cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine‐based inhibitory motif domains (TIGIT) inhibitor + an anti‐programmed cell death protein 1 (PD‐1) antibody is a promising combination which shows potent efficacy in solid tumors. AdvanTIG‐105 is a Phase 1/1b open‐label study designed to assess the safety and preliminary antitumor activity of OCI, an anti‐TIGIT monoclonal antibody (mAb), + TIS, an anti‐PD‐1 mAb, in pts with metastatic unresectable solid tumors (NCT04047862). In the dose‐escalation part, OCI + TIS was well tolerated, preliminary efficacy was observed, and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of OCI 900 mg intravenous (IV) every three weeks (Q3W) + TIS 200 mg IV Q3W was established. We report results from the dose‐expansion (Cohorts 1 [C1] & 2 [C2]) of the AdvanTIG‐105 study. Methods: Treatment‐naïve adult pts with histologically/cytologically confirmed metastatic sq (C1) or non‐sq with EGFR/ALK/ROS‐1 wild‐type tumors (C2) NSCLC were enrolled. Pts in C1 received the RP2D of OCI + TIS with paclitaxel/nab‐paclitaxel + carboplatin and pts in C2 received the RP2D of OCI + TIS with pemetrexed + cisplatin/carboplatin, both until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was investigator‐assessed objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1. Secondary endpoints included safety. Results: As of March 18, 2022, 84 pts were enrolled (C1: n=41; C2: n=43). The median study follow‐up was 17.7 weeks (range 1.1–42.6) in C1 and 15.0 weeks (3.0–51.1) in C2. Of the 76 efficacy‐evaluable pts, the confirmed ORR in C1 was 45.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.3, 0.6) and 25.6% (95% CI: 0.1, 0.4) in C2. In total, 81 pts (96.4%) experienced ≥ 1 treatment‐emergent adverse event (TEAE), and 48 pts (57.1%) had ≥ Grade 3 TEAEs. Serious TEAEs occurred in 26 pts (31.0%). The most common TEAEs were anemia (41.7%), neutrophil count decreased (33.3%), and white blood cell count decreased (33.3%). Conclusions: The RP2D of OCI 900 mg IV Q3W and TIS 200 mg IV Q3W + chemo was generally well tolerated and showed antitumor activity in pts with treatment‐naïve metastatic sq/non‐sq NSCLC. Prof. Y.

Nivolumab (NIVO) + low-dose ipilimumab (IPI) vs platinum-doublet chemotherapy (chemo) as first-line (1L) treatment (tx) for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): checkMate 227 part 1 final analysis,"Background: Part 1 of CheckMate 227 (NCT02477826), a phase III study in 1L NSCLC, has dual primary endpoints. The primary endpoint of progression‐free survival (PFS) with NIVO + IPI vs chemo in patients (pts) with tumor mutational burden ≥ 10 mut/Mb was met, as reported previously. Here we present the primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) for NIVO + IPI vs chemo in pts with tumor PD‐L1 expression ≥ 1%. Methods: Pts were chemo‐naive, with stage IV or recurrent NSCLC without EGFR or known ALK alterations, ECOG PS 0–1. Pts with PD‐L1 ≥1% (n = 1189) were randomized 1:1:1 to NIVO 3 mg/kg Q2W + IPI 1 mg/kg Q6W, NIVO 240 mg Q2W, or histology‐based chemo; pts with PD‐L1 < 1% (n = 550) were randomized 1:1:1 to NIVO 3 mg/kg Q2W + IPI 1 mg/kg Q6W, NIVO 360 mg Q3W + chemo, or chemo. Pts were stratified by histology in both populations. Pts were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or for 2 y of immunotherapy. Results: Baseline characteristics were balanced across tx arms. Minimum follow‐up for the primary endpoint was 29.3 mo. For pts with PD‐L1 ≥ 1%, OS was significantly longer with NIVO + IPI vs chemo (HR 0.79, 97.72% CI: 0.65–0.96; P = 0.007); PFS, objective response rates, and duration of response favored NIVO + IPI vs chemo. OS benefit was also observed in pts with PD‐L1 < 1% and all randomized pts (Table). Prespecified analyses showed enhanced efficacy with NIVO + IPI relative to NIVO in PD‐L1 ≥ 1% and relative to NIVO + chemo in PD‐L1 < 1%. Grade 3–4 tx‐related adverse event rates in all randomized pts were 33% with NIVO + low‐dose IPI, 19% with NIVO, and 36% with chemo. [Table presented] Conclusions: CheckMate 227 met its primary endpoint of significantly improved OS with NIVO + IPI vs chemo in 1L advanced NSCLC with PD‐L1 ≥ 1%. OS was also improved with NIVO + IPI in PD‐L1 < 1% and in all randomized pts. Safety profile was consistent with previous reports in NSCLC. NIVO + IPI represents a new chemo‐free tx option for pts in 1L advanced NSCLC. Clinical trial identification: NCT02477826; Release date: June 23, 2015.

Osimertinib vs standard of care (SoC) EGFR-TKI as first line therapy in patients (pts) with untreated EGFRm advanced NSCLC: FLAURA post-progression outcomes,"Background: In the FLAURA phase 3 study (NCT02296125), the third‐generation EGFR‐TKI osimertinib significantly improved progression‐free survival (PFS) vs SoC EGFR‐TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) in pts with previously untreated Ex19del/L858R (EGFRm) advanced NSCLC (hazard ratio [HR] 0.46 [95% CI 0.37, 0.57]; p < 0.001). Interim overall survival (OS) data was encouraging but not formally statistically significant (HR 0.63 [95% CI 0.45, 0.88]; p = 0.007). Here we report exploratory post‐progression outcomes. Methods: Pts were randomised 1:1 to receive osimertinib (80 mg orally [PO], once daily [QD]) or SoC (gefitinib 250 mg PO QD or erlotinib 150 mg PO QD). Treatment beyond disease progression was allowed if the investigator judged continued clinical benefit; investigators determined subsequent therapy. Pts receiving SoC could cross over to osimertinib after objective disease progression with documented post‐progression T790M‐positive mutation status. Results: At data cutoff, 12 June 2017, 138/279 (49%) and 213/277 (77%) pts discontinued osimertinib and SoC, respectively; 82 (29%) and 129 (47%) received a subsequent treatment: EGFR‐TKI‐containing, 29 (10%) and 97 (35%; 55 [20%] osimertinib); platinum chemotherapy‐containing, 46 (16%) and 27 (10%). Median time (mths) to discontinuation of study treatment or death: osimertinib 20.8 (95% CI 17.2, 24.1) vs SoC 11.5 (10.3, 12.8). Median time (mths) to discontinuation of any EGFR‐TKI (study treatment and subsequent EGFR‐TKI, not interrupted by non‐EGFR‐TKI therapy) or death: osimertinib 23.0 (19.5, not calculable [NC]) vs SoC 16.0 (14.8, 18.6). Time‐to‐event post‐progression endpoints all favoured osimertinib (Table). Calculated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. HR and CI were obtained directly from the U and V statistics. The analysis was performed using a log rank test stratified by race (Asian versus non‐Asian) and mutation type (Ex19del vs L858R). 2‐sided p‐value. CI, confidence interval; FST, first subsequent therapy (second‐line treatment); HR, hazard ratio; NC, not calculable; PFS2, second progression‐free survival (or death) post initiation of second‐line treatment (i.e. time from randomisation to second progression on subsequent treatment); TFST, time to first subsequent therapy or death; TSST, time to second subsequent therapy or death; SST, second subsequent therapy; RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1. Conclusions: PFS benefit with osimertinib was preserved throughout time‐to‐event postprogression endpoints. Step‐wise increase of the statistically significant HRs (PFS 0.46, TFST 0.51, PFS2 0.58, TSST 0.60) provides confidence in the interim OS data.

IMpower150: impact of Chemotherapy Cycles in 1L Metastatic NSCLC in Patients Treated With Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab,"Background: In the randomized Phase III IMpower150 study, atezolizumab (anti–programmed death‐ligand 1 [PD‐L1]) + bevacizumab + chemotherapy (Arm B) showed statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in both progression‐free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) over bevacizumab + chemotherapy (Arm C) in patients with first‐line (1L) nonsquamous non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study protocol allowed investigator choice of 4 or 6 chemotherapy cycles. The objective of this exploratory analysis was to assess the impact of chemotherapy cycles on safety and efficacy outcomes. Method: Patients were categorized based on actual chemotherapy cycles received in Arm B. Landmark analysis of PFS was performed to assess the benefit of 4 vs 6 chemotherapy cycles. Sensitivity analyses were performed to adjust the numerically imbalanced baseline factors. Result: A total of 356 patients were randomized in Arm B; 188 patients (53%) were planned to receive 4 cycles, and 168 patients (47%) were planned to receive 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Within these 2 groups, 143 (76%) and 98 patients (58%) completed 4 and 6 chemotherapy cycles, respectively. The demographic and baseline disease characteristics were balanced, except for race (Asian vs other), smoking status, and PD‐L1 status (TC3 or IC3 vs other). The landmark PFS analysis showed no difference between patients who completed 4 vs 6 cycles (HR 0.83 [95% CI: 0.59, 1.17). The sensitivity analyses, which adjusted for race, smoking status, or PD‐L1, showed comparable results (adjusted HRs of 0.80, 0.85, or 0.91, respectively). Conclusion: In the atezolizumab + bevacizumab + chemotherapy arm, patients who received 4 cycles of chemotherapy appeared to have similar PFS benefit as those who received 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Detailed analyses of varying chemotherapy cycles, safety analyses, and impact on OS will be presented.

Osimertinib vs comparator EGFR-TKI as first-line treatment for EGFRm advanced NSCLC (FLAURA): final overall survival analysis,"Background: Osimertinib is a 3rd‐generation, irreversible, oral EGFR‐TKI that potently and selectively inhibits both EGFR‐mutated (EGFRm) and EGFR T790M resistance mutations, and has demonstrated efficacy in NSCLC CNS metastases. In the phase III FLAURA study (NCT02296125), osimertinib resulted in significant progression‐ free survival (PFS) benefit (primary endpoint; datacut off [DCO] 12 June 2017) over comparator EGFR‐TKI (HR 0.46, p<0.001). Overall survival (OS) data were immature (25% maturity) at that time. Here, we report the final OS analysis (58% maturity). Methods: Eligible patients (pts): ≥18 years (Japan: ≥20), treatment‐naïve with Ex19del/L858R EGFRm advanced NSCLC;WHOperformance status 0‐1.

Osimertinib vs comparator EGFR-TKI as first-line treatment for EGFRm advanced NSCLC (FLAURA): final overall survival analysis,"Introduction: Osimertinib is a third‐generation, irreversible, oral EGFR‐ TKI that potently and selectively inhibits both EGFRm and EGFR T790M, and has demonstrated efficacy in NSCLC CNS metastases. The Phase III FLAURA study (NCT02296125) compared first‐line osimertinib vs comparator EGFR‐TKI in EGFRm advanced NSCLC. Median progression‐ free survival (PFS; primary analysis, data cutoff June 12 2017) was significantly longer with osimertinib than comparator EGFR‐TKI (18.9 months vs 10.2 months; p< 0.001). Overall survival (OS) data were immature (25% maturity) at the time of the primary publication. Methods: Patients (pts; 556 globally) were randomised 1:1 to osimertinib 80 mg once daily (qd) orally (po) or comparator EGFR‐TKI (gefitinib 250 mg qd or erlotinib 150 mg qd po) and stratified by race (Asian/non‐Asian) and mutation status (Ex19del/L858R). Inclusion criteria: ≥18 years (Japan: ≥20); treatment‐naïve with Ex19del/L858R EGFRm advanced NSCLC; WHO performance status 0‐1; neurologically stable pts with CNS metastases were allowed, provided definitive treatment/steroids were completed for ≥2 weeks. Treatment beyond progression (by RECIST 1.1, per investigator) was allowed if clinical benefit continued; pts randomised to the comparator arm could crossover to osimertinib if T790M positive (tissue or plasma) on progression (confirmed by blinded independent central review). Primary endpoint: PFS by RECIST 1.1, per investigator. OS is a secondary endpoint. Safety and tolerability outcome measures include: adverse events (CTCAE v4); clinical and physical assessments. Results: The protocol‐defined maturity of data for final OS analysis (approximately 60% maturity across both arms) is anticipated by August 2019. Median OS and 2‐ and 3‐ year survival rates will be reported for each treatment arm. OS across predefined subgroups will be shown, including subgroups based on race and EGFR mutation type.

Safety and efficacy of dacomitinib for EGFR+ NSCLC in the subgroup of Asian patients from ARCHER 1050,"Background: In the ongoing phase 3 comparison of dacomitinib (daco) and gefitinib (gef) (ARCHER 1050; NCT01774721) as first‐line therapy for EGFR‐mutation‐positive (EGFR+) advanced NSCLC, daco was associated with significant improvement in progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Here we present results for the subset of Asian patients (pts). Methods: Eligible pts with newly diagnosed stage IIIB/IV or recurrent EGFR+ advanced NSCLC were randomized (1:1) to oral daco 45 mg once daily or gef 250 mg. Randomization was stratified by race and EGFR mutation (exon 19 del/exon 21 L858R) status. The primary efficacy endpoint was PFS by blinded independent radiologic central review (BIRC). Secondary endpoints were OS, objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) by BIRC, and safety. Results: Of 346 Asian pts, 170 were randomized to daco treatment and 176 to gef. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the groups were well balanced. At the July 29,2016 data cutoff, the hazard ratio for PFS was 0.510 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.392,0.664), favoring daco (2‐sided p value < 0.0001). Median PFS was 16.5 months (95% CI 12.9,18.4) for daco and 9.3 months for gef (95% CI 9.2,11.0). OS, ORR and DOR are shown in the table. Treatment‐related adverse events (TRAEs) occurring in > 50% of daco‐treated pts were diarrhea (88.2%), paronychia (64.7%), and dermatitis acneiform (56.5%). In the gef arm, diarrhea (52.3%) was the only TRAE that occurred in > 50% of pts. The daco dose was reduced in 67.6% of pts associated with adverse events (AEs); gef dose was reduced to every other day dosing in 9.7% of pts associated with AEs. Conclusions: First‐line daco was associated with significant prolongation of PFS compared with gef in Asian pts with EGFR+ advanced NSCLC. Daco treatment showed improved OS, ORR, and DOR compared to gef treatment. The AE profile for daco and gef in Asian pts was consistent with the overall ARCHER 1050 study.","['Mok, TSK', 'Cheng, Y', 'Zhou, X', 'Lee, KH', 'Nakagawa, K', 'Niho, S', 'Rosell, R', 'Linke, R', 'Wong, CH', 'Tang, Y', 'et al.']",10.1093/annonc/mdz437.006
Updated overall survival (OS) from extended follow up in ARCHER 1050: a randomized phase III study comparing dacomitinib with gefitinib as first-line therapy for patients (pts) with EGFR mutations,"Background: The ongoing phase III ARCHER 1050 study (NCT01774721) compared dacomitinib (daco) with gefitinib (gef) as first‐line therapy for pts with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor‐positive (EGFR+) non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Progression‐free survival, duration of response, and OS significantly improved with daco vs gef. The improvement in OS was previously reported after median follow‐up of 31.3 months (mo) with 220 (48.7%) total deaths. Here, final OS results are reported after a median follow‐up of 47.9 mo in ARCHER 1050 to evaluate the persistence of OS improvementwith daco. Methods: Pts with newly diagnosed EGFR+ NSCLC were randomized 1:1to daco or gef. Randomization was stratified by race and EGFR mutation type. Results: Over a median follow‐up of 47.9 mo as of 13 May 2019, 285 deaths occurred (133 [58.6%]in the daco arm[n=227] and 152 [67.6%] inthe gef arm[n=225]). OS was still significantly improved with daco vs gef (stratified hazard ratio [HR], 0.748; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.591‐0.947; 2‐sided P = 0.0155). Median OS (95% CI) with daco was 34.1 mo (29.5‐39.8) vs 27.0 mo (24.4‐31.6) with gef. OS30 was 56.4% with daco and 45.7% with gef. Median OS, unstratified HR, and P values for interaction are also reported by race and EGFR mutation type (Table). Dose reductions occurred in 154 (67.8%) pts receiving daco; median OS (95% CI) in pts with and without dose reductions was 42.5 (36.7‐not estimable [NE]) and 20.7 (15.4‐25.6) mo, respectively. In pts reduced to alowest daco dose of 30mg (n=89) and15mg (n=65), median OS was 36.7 mo (28.8‐44.7) and NE (40.1 mo‐NE), respectively. Conclusions: With extended follow‐up (median 47.9 mo), daco continues to improve OS over gef in pts with advanced EGFR+ NSCLC; the same trend was observedin most subgroups defined by race and EGFR status. The benefit of OS was maintained in patients who received dose reductions.","['Mok, TSK', 'Cheng, Y', 'Zhou, X', 'Lee, KH', 'Nakagawa, K', 'Niho, S', 'Linke, R', 'Rosell, R', 'Corral, J', 'Migliorino, MR', 'et al.']",10.1093/annonc/mdz446.018
"A phase III randomized study of image guided conventional (60 Gy/30 fx) versus accelerated, hypofractionated (60 Gy/15 fx) radiation for poor performance status stage II and III NSCLC patientsdan interim analysis","Purpose/Objective(s): To evaluate overall survival (OS) in a comparison of image guided conventional versus accelerated, hypofractionated radiation delivered to poor performance status (PS) stage II and III non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in a randomized phase III study. Materials/Methods: All patients with stage II NSCLC not candidates for surgery or stage III NSCLC not candidates for chemoradiation due to diminished PS (Zubrod PS 2 or greater) were eligible for this phase III randomized trial of radiation alone comparing conventional regimes of 60‐66Gy/30‐33fx (Arm A) versus accelerated, hypofractionated 60Gy/15fx (Arm B). Overall survival was the primary endpoint with several secondary endpoints including toxicity assessment, progression free survival (PFS), quality of life, and cost effectiveness. Chemotherapy was permissible sequentially either as induction or in the adjuvant setting. The study was open at more than 10 institutions across the state of Texas. Results: To date, 60 patients have been enrolled on the study (28 to Arm A and 32 to Arm B), with a median age of 68y in both cohorts. There is an equal M:F ratio in Arm B but a 4:1 M:F ratio in Arm A. 53% of all lesions are squamous cell carcinoma, with the rest adenocarcinoma, equally weighted in the cohorts. 53/60 patients presented with stage III disease, 7/ 60 with stage II. 48/60 patients were evaluable due to adequate length of follow‐up at this time. 56% of patients (27/48) were alive at last follow‐up. By Kaplan‐Meier analysis, median OS for the 48 patients evaluable was 11.5 months, with no statistical difference between conventional vs hypofractionated radiation treatment arms. PFS was 14 months with again no statistical difference between treatment arms. In Arm A, 2 deaths from hypoxia were possibly related to conventional radiation, 1 death in Arm B from hypoxia was possibly related to hypofractionated radiation. No grade 4 toxicities were attributed to radiation. There were 10 (Arm A) vs 6 (Arm B) grade 3 toxicities. Conclusion: A curative approach with accelerated, hypofractionated radiation alone is equivalent in OS and PFS to conventional radiation in a population of poor PS patients, with less grade 3‐5 toxicity, and a treatment course of half the time. Completion of this study will potentially change the paradigm of treatment of poor PS stage III NSCLC patients who cannot receive chemoradiation.","['Iyengar, P', 'Westover, KD', 'Court, LE', 'Patel, MK', 'Shivnani, AT', 'Saunders, MW', 'Li, Y', 'Chang, JY', 'Gao, A', 'Ahn, C', 'et al.']",10.1016/j.ijrobp.2016.06.1763
MA01.06 Effects of the Immunotherapy Era on Maintenance Outcomes in Advanced Nonsquamous NSCLC: subgroup Analysis of ECOG 5508,"Introduction: The ECOG 5508 (E5508) study, which enrolled patients from 2010‐2015, evaluated pemetrexed, bevacizumab, or the combination as maintenance therapy for advanced nonsquamous non‐small‐cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Results showed that single‐agent bevacizumab or pemetrexed were equally efficacious in regards to progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Combination therapy improved PFS, but the difference in OS was not statistically significant. Treatment practice changed in 2015 with the approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors for second line therapy in metastatic NSCLC with progression on or after platinum based therapy. Patients who were enrolled in E5508 later in the registration period would have most likely received immunotherapy after progression, which could potentially have had an effect on OS in these patients. A subgroup analysis was performed to evaluate this possibility. Methods: The 874 patients in the E5508 trial who were randomized to one of the maintenance therapy arms were divided into two groups based on registration date before or after 2014‐01‐01, chosen because patients who enrolled in the study in 2014 or later most likely would have been treated with immunotherapy at progression. These two groups were divided into three subgroups based on the maintenance treatment they received. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method. Cox models were performed to examine the differences among the subgroups in OS and DFS. Results: 444 patients were in the “Before‐IO” group. This total was evenly split between the 3 maintenance subgroups. 430 patients fell into the “After‐IO” group. In this group, 139, 146, and 145 patients received bevacizumab, pemetrexed, and the combination respectively. The interaction test between registration group and treatment were not significant. PFS continued to be significantly improved in both combination subgroups with no significant change by enrollment period (HR “Before‐IO” 0.70, p=0.006, HR “After‐IO” 0.63, p=<0.001). Median OS in the “Before‐IO” group with combination maintenance was 15.8 months compared to 14.6 and 14.4 months with pemetrexed and bevacizumab respectively (HR of combination vs. bevacizumab 0.85, p=0.21), while the ""After‐IO"" combination subgroup OS was 17 months compared to 19 and 13.3 months for pemetrexed and bevacizumab monotherapy (HR of combination vs. bevacizumab 0.97, p=0.83). Conclusion: There was a favorable trend towards improved OS, although not statistically significant, in the “Before‐IO” combination maintenance subgroup compared to the bevacizumab subgroup. This suggests that studies that enrolled patients both before and after 2014 may have been impacted by subsequent IO treatments. There was also an increase in median OS for both the pemetrexed and combination “After‐IO” groups, suggesting a broad impact on OS from immunotherapy.

"A randomized, controlled, open label phase II study of erlotinib (E) with or without the MET antibody emibetuzumab (Emi) as first-line treatment for EGFRmt non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who have disease control after an 8-week lead-in treatment with erlotinib","Background: MET expression is a mechanism of resistance to EGFR inhibition in EGFRmt NSCLC and correlated with poor prognosis. Emi (LY2875358) is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal bivalent MET antibody that blocks ligand dependent and independent HGF/MET signaling. This Phase 2 study compared the clinical activity of Emi + E versus single agent E in 1st line EGFRmt metastatic NSCLC. Methods: Stage IV, EGFRmt NSCLC pts with disease control following an 8‐week lead‐in E (150 mg PO QD) treatment were randomized 1:1 to receive Emi (750 mg IV Q2W) + E or E alone. Pts were stratified by ECOG PS, ethnicity, MET expression status, and response at the end of the lead‐in. The primary endpoint was PFS from randomization. Additional endpoints included safety, OS, PK, and exploratory analysis of MET‐expressing populations. Results: Out of181 pts enrolled, 141 pts were randomized (Emi+E: 71; E: 70). In the ITT population, median PFS for EMI+E was 9.3 months (m) compared with 9.5 m for E (HR = 0.89: 90% CI 0.64‐1.23; p = 0.534). Exploratory analysis of MET‐high expressing pts (MET 3+ expression in ≥90% of tumor cells; n = 24 pts) showed a 15.3 m improvement in PFS (EMI+E: 20.7 m; E: 5.4 m [HR: 0.39; 90% CI: 0.17‐0.91]). No difference in PFS was observed in the complementary population (HR: 1.1 [90% CI: 0.7‐1.7]). Similar frequencies of related AEs were reported for both treatment arms. Drug‐related TEAEs that were more frequent ( > 10%) for Emi+E were peripheral edema and fatigue (all grade 1 or 2). Emi serum concentrations were consistent with previously obtained PK results, and no apparent exposure‐response was observed. Median OS in the ITT population was not achieved (NA) for either arm. In MET‐high expressing pts, median OS was 20.6 m for E (90% CI: 8.87, NA) whereas it was not achieved for Emi+E (90% CI: NA, NA). Conclusions: No statistically significant difference in PFS was noted in the ITT population. Exploratory analysis confirmed that high MET expression is a negative prognostic marker for pts treated with E and indicated that these pts may receive clinically meaningful benefit from Emi+E.","['Scagliotti, GV', 'Moro-Sibilot, D', 'Kollmeier, J', 'Favaretto, AG', 'Cho, EK', 'Grosch, H', 'Kimmich, M', 'Girard, N', 'Tsai, C-M', 'Hsia, T-C', 'et al.']",
Overall survival results of a randomized trial assessing patient-reported outcomes for symptom monitoring during routine cancer treatment,"Background: We previously reported significant benefits in quality of life, patient satisfaction, and emergency room utilization outcomes from a large single‐center randomized controlled trial comparing web‐based symptom monitoring with patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) vs. usual care in patients receiving chemotherapy for metastatic solid tumors (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00578006). We now present overall survival results from this trial. Methods: Patients receiving routine outpatient chemotherapy for metastatic solid tumors at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were randomly assigned to self‐report 12 common symptoms via tablet computers (“PRO intervention”), or to usual care. Treating physicians received symptom printouts at visits and nurses received email alerts when participants reported severe or worsening symptoms. Overall survival was tabulated based on medical records and Social Security Death Index data, estimated using the Kaplan‐Meier method, and compared between arms using a log‐rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression adjusting for age, sex, race, education level, and cancer type. Results: Between September 2007 and January 2011, 766 patients were randomized, with median age 61 (range 26‐91), 86% white, 58% female, and 22% with less than high school education. Cancer types included genitourinary (32% of patients), gynecologic (23%), breast (19%), and lung cancer (26%). Survival results were assessed in June 2016 after a median follow up of 7 years and 517/766 (67%) of participants had died. Median overall survival in the PRO intervention arm was 5 months longer than the control arm (31.2 vs. 26.0 months, p = 0.03). In the multivariable model, results remained statistically significant with a hazard ratio of 0.832 (p = 0.04; 95% CI; 0.696, 0.995). Conclusions: Systematic symptom monitoring during outpatient chemotherapy using web‐based patient‐reported outcomes confers overall survival benefits.

"1338P A phase III study comparing BCD-021, a bevacizumab biosimilar, and reference bevacizumab in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-squamous NSCLC","Background: BCD‐021 (JSC BIOCAD) is a biosimilar of the reference bevacizumab (Avastin®). This study compared the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of BCD‐021 to BEV in patients with stage IIIB or IV non‐squamous non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: In this randomised, double‐blind, multicentre study, patients were randomised in a ratio 1:1 (for Russia, Belarus and Ukraine) and 2:1 (for India) to receive BCD‐021 or BEV with paclitaxel and carboplatin Q3W for 6 cycles. Patients with stable disease, complete or partial responses at Week 18 were offered BCD‐021 until disease progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. The primary efficacy endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) based on responses achieved by Week 19 and confirmed 4 weeks thereafter. Primary PK endpoint was AUC(0‐t) after first infusion. Secondary endpoints were safety, PK, and immunogenicity. Results: A total of 357 patients were randomized and 341 patients (BCD‐021, n=205; BEV, n=136) were treated and had at least 1 CT scan after initiation of study treatment (mITT population). Baseline characteristics were balanced between BCD‐021 and BEV with the exception for race. In the, the ORR was 34.6% in BCD‐021 and 33.8% in BEV; the risk difference was 0.8% and its 95% CI was [‐9.5 %, 11.1 %]. The 90% CI for risk ratio was [79.6%, 131.7%]. CIs were within the pre‐defined equivalence margins of [‐18%, 18%] for risk difference and [67%, 150%] for risk ratio. Sensitivity analysis for ORR with race as covariate resulted in 90% CI for risk ratio [79.2%, 132.1%]. The 90% CIs for the ratios of geometric means of AUC(0‐t) values for BCD‐021 and BEV were within the pre‐defined equivalence margin of [80%, 125%] for Indian and non‐Indian patient populations. The overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) was comparable between BCD‐021 vs BEV (91.3% vs 93.4%). The most frequently occurring AEs were anaemia, neutropenia and alopecia. PK parameters (Ctrough and Cmax) and the incidence of anti‐drug antibodies were comparable between BCD‐021 and BEV. Conclusions: This study demonstrated equivalence between BCD‐021 and BEV in terms of ORR risk difference and risk ratio.

Osimertinib is a third‐generation, irreversible, CNS‐active EGFR‐TKI selective for EGFRm and T790M, recommended in patients with T790M‐positive advanced NSCLC who have progressed on first‐line EGFR‐TKIs. In a recent study (NCT01405079), gefitinib treatment in patients with resected EGFRmpositive NSCLC significantly increased disease‐free survival (DFS) vs vinorelbine+cisplatin: median 28.7 vs 18.0 months (hazard ratio 0.60 (95% CI 0.42e0.87), p=0.005), warranting further investigation of EGFR‐TKIs in this setting (Wu et al, J Clin Oncol 2017;35:suppl;abs8500). Osimertinib may prolong DFS in adjuvant EGFRm‐positive NSCLC. Method: Trial Design ADAURA (NCT02511106) is a global, Phase III, double‐blind, randomized study, assessing efficacy and safety of osimertinib vs placebo in patients with stage IBeIIIA non‐squamous EGFRm‐positive NSCLC with complete tumor resection. Approximately 700 patients from 210 sites will be randomized. A planned 60% of patients will be recruited from Asia, 40% from non‐Asian countries; 70% stage IIeIIIA, 30% stage IB. Patients must be adults ≥18 years (Japan/Taiwan: ≥20) with primary NSCLC staged post‐operatively as IB/II/IIIA, and central confirmation of Ex19del or L858R (alone or combined with other EGFR mutations including T790M). Complete surgical resection of the primary NSCLC is mandatory; patients will have baseline CT scans within 28 days prior to treatment confirming radiographic absence of residual disease. Complete surgical recovery is required for randomization; treatment to start at least 4 weeks following surgery. Patients who have received radiation therapy, pre‐operative chemotherapy, prior anticancer therapy or neoadjuvant/adjuvant EGFR‐TKI treatment are exempt. Standard post‐operative adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of a platinumbased doublet for 4 cycles maximum, is allowed; no more than 10 and 26 weeks may have elapsed between surgery and randomization for patients who have not or have received adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to once‐daily osimertinib 80 mg or placebo and stratified by stage (IB/II/IIIA), mutation type (Ex19Del/L858R) and race (Asian/non‐Asian). Treatment may continue for 3 years in absence of discontinuation criteria including disease recurrence. Primary objective is to assess the efficacy of osimertinib vs placebo, measured by investigator‐assessed DFS. Secondary objectives include assessment of the safety profile of osimertinib vs placebo; DFS rate at 2, 3, 5 years; overall survival (OS); 5‐year OS rate; health‐related quality of life; pharmacokinetics. Estimated primary completion date (final DFS data collection date): July 2021. Result: Not applicable. Conclusion: Not applicable.","['Herbst, R', 'Wu, Y', 'Mann, H', 'Rukazenkov, Y', 'Marotti, M', 'Tsuboi, M']",
P1.06-01 Adjuvant Osimertinib vs Placebo in Completely Resected Stage IA2-IA3 EGFR-mutated NSCLC: the ADAURA2 Phase III Study,"Introduction: Management of patients with stage IA epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)‐mutated non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is currently restricted to observation following complete tumor resection. No widely approved systemic adjuvant therapy has demonstrated a disease‐free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) benefit in this setting. Approximately 25ꟷ30% of patients with stage IA NSCLC will have recurrent disease within 5 years, often involving distant metastases. Osimertinib is a third‐generation, central nervous system (CNS)‐active EGFR‐tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) selective for EGFR‐TKI sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. Based on results from the Phase III ADAURA study (NCT02511106), adjuvant osimertinib is the first targeted therapy approved for patients with stage IBꟷIIIA resected NSCLC, after a statistically significant improvement in DFS versus placebo was demonstrated (HR=0.20, 99.12% CI: 0.14ꟷ0.30; p<0.001). ADAURA2 (NCT05120349) is a global, randomized, double‐blind Phase III study assessing the efficacy and safety of osimertinib compared with placebo as adjuvant therapy for patients with stage IA2ꟷIA3 EGFR‐mutated NSCLC following complete tumor resection. Methods: Eligible patients will be aged ≥18 years with histologically confirmed primary non‐squamous stage IA2ꟷIA3 NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 19 deletion (ex19del) or L858R mutations, either alone or in combination with other EGFR mutations. Patients must have recovered from complete surgical resection (R0) of the primary NSCLC by lobectomy/segmentectomy/sleeve resection, be between 4ꟷ12 weeks after surgery at the time of randomization, and have a World Health Organization performance status of 0/1. Patients with mixed small cell and non‐small cell histologies; incomplete (R1/R2) resection, or who underwent pneumonectomy/wedge resection; and/or received any other type of anticancer therapy for NSCLC, are excluded. Approximately 380 patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral osimertinib 80 mg or placebo once daily, for 3 years or until disease recurrence/discontinuation. Patients will be stratified by risk (high‐risk [defined as having any of the following pathologic factors: invasive component of tumor diameter >2cm, lymphovascular invasion, high‐grade histology] vs low‐risk [no high‐risk features]), race (Chinese Asian/non‐Chinese Asian/non‐Asian), and EGFR mutation type (ex19del/L858R). Patients experiencing Grade 1/2 interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis may continue (Grade 1) or restart (if Grade 2 symptoms resolve within 4 weeks of interruption) study treatment. Primary endpoint: DFS per investigator assessment in the high‐risk stratum; secondary endpoints include DFS in the overall population, CNS DFS, OS, HRQoL, safety/tolerability. The study is currently recruiting; interim analysis of the primary endpoint is expected August 2027, with final completion in November 2032.

Pooled efficacy and safety data of alectinib (A) vs. crizotinib (C) from the randomized phase III ALEX and J-ALEX trials,"Background: Among patients (pts) with ALK+ advanced non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) naïve to ALK‐inhibitors, A significantly prolonged progression‐free survival (PFS) over C. We present results of a post‐hoc patient‐level pooled analysis at interim data cut‐off of the randomized phase III trials ALEX (NCT02075840) and J‐ALEX (JapicCTI‐132316), exploring new prognostic factors. Methods: In both studies, the primary endpoint was PFS by RECIST v1.1. Treatment crossover was only allowed in the J‐ALEX trial. Multivariate analysis was performed by Cox’s model, the independence of the two trial data sets was managed by random effects models. Survival outcomes were correlated with baseline characteristics including high tumor burden (hTB, i.e. > median sum of diameter of target lesions) and body mass index (BMI). Results: The pooled set included 500 pts (A=249, C=251) with data available for survival and safety analysis. There was no imbalance between A and C groups in age (median 58 vs 56), sex (female 58% vs 59%), brain metastases (29% vs 34%), BMI (<25 70% vs 67%). At a median follow‐up of 17.1 months, A provided prolonged PFS over C (median not reached vs. 10.2 months, HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.31‐0.55, p<0.001), with median OS not reached in any arm (HR 0.80, 95% 0.50‐1.28, p=0.353). In the multivariate analysis with correction for ethnicity, hTB (>55mm) was linked to worse PFS regardless of the treatment received (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.26‐2.20, p<0.001), and BMI ≥25 was correlated with better OS compared to BMI <25 (HR 0.50, 95% 0.29‐0.88, p=0.025). Treatment effectiveness in subgroups is shown in table. Significant interaction between treatment and TB (p=0.002) was found in subgroup PFS analysis. Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 36% of pts with A vs 51% with C, 15% of pts discontinued A vs 20% C. [Formula presented] Conclusions: hTB is a prognostic and predictive factor in patients with advanced ALK+ NSCLC under ALK‐inhibitors, while a BMI ≥25 is linked to a reduced risk of death. Escalation strategies could be explored for hTB. Clinical trial identification: This is a pooled analysis of ALEX (NCT02075840) and J‐ALEX (JapicCTI‐132316) trials.

"OA22.06 Changes in Cognition after Osimertinib, with or without SRS, in EGFRm NSCLC with Brain Metastases: a Pooled Analysis of RCTs","Introduction: The optimal sequencing of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) with Osimertinib in epidermal growth factor receptor mutated (EGFRm) non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and untreated brain metastases (BM) is unclear. LUOSICNS and TROG 17.02 OUTRUN are randomized phase II trials comparing SRS followed by Osimertinib versus Osimertinib alone with a primary outcome of 12‐month intracranial progression‐free survival (PFS). Here we report a pooled analysis of participants’ self‐reported cognitive function and the incidence of radionecrosis (secondary outcomes). Methods: LUOSICNS and OUTRUN recruited participants from Canada and Australia / Singapore, respectively. Participants had up to 10 BM at registration with at least one BM amenable to SRS and diameter of the largest BM 30mm. SRS was delivered as single or multi‐fraction regimens depending on BM size and location according to trial protocol. Osimertinib was administered orally as 80mg tablet daily. Both newly diagnosed participants with advanced NSCLC with a sensitizing EGFR mutation as well as those who developed EGFR exon 20 T790M resistance mutation after first or second‐generation EGFR inhibitors were recruited. Cognitive function was self‐reported using the cognitive functioning domain within the EORTC‐QLQ C30 instrument. Assessment of health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) was made at baseline, 3 months and 6 months after registration. A worsening of 10 points from baseline was considered a significant deterioration. Radionecrosis was defined based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or histology. A surveillance brain MRI was performed every two months for OUTRUN and three months for LUOSICNS for the first‐year post‐randomization. Results: Seventy‐eight participants were included; 38 randomized to upfront SRS and 40 to upfront Osimertinib. Seventy‐nine percent of the participants were followed up for at least six months. Median age was 67 years. Participants were predominantly female (67 %), Asian ethnicity (72 %), never smokers (72%) and had newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC (88%). For the entire group, the median number of BM at registration was 3.5 (interquartile range (IQR) 2.0 to 6.0) and the median diameter of the largest BM was 13mm (IQR 10mm to 16mm). Baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. At baseline, the median scores for cognitive functioning in both treatment groups were 83 and 83, respectively. The proportions of participants with deterioration in cognitive functioning in the upfront SRS group were 33% (7/21) at three months and 19% (4/21) at six months. In the upfront Osimertinib group, the proportions were 36% (8/22) at three months and 28% (7/25) at six months. Among those assigned to upfront SRS, two (5%) had grade one, one (2.5%) had grade two and one (2.5%) had grade three radionecrosis. Conclusions: These preliminary data demonstrate a significant decline in self‐reported cognition in about one‐third of participants within the first six months of randomization in both treatment arms. The incidence of symptomatic radionecrosis within 6 months from SRS was very low. Comparative outcomes for intracranial PFS and overall survival between treatment groups are still maturing. These data, combined with the impact of treatment sequencing on cognition and HRQoL, will further inform treatment recommendations for this population.

"A randomized, double-blind trial comparing continuous thoracic epidural bupivacaine with and without opioid in contrast to a continuous paravertebral infusion of bupivacaine for post-thoracotomy pain","OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of continuous epidural bupivacaine analgesia with and without hydromorphone to continuous paravertebral analgesia with bupivcaine in patients with post‐thoracotomy pain. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, double‐blinded trial. SETTING: A teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients at a tertiary care teaching hospital undergoing throracotomy for lung cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were assigned randomly to receive a continuous thoracic epidural or paravertebral infusion. Patients in the epidural group were randomized to receive either bupivacaine alone or in combination with hydromorphone. Visual analog scores as well as incentive spirometery results were obtained before and after thoracotomy. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy‐five consecutive patients presenting for thoracotomy were enrolled in this institutional review board‐approved study. On the morning of surgery, subjects were randomized to either an epidural group receiving bupvicaine with and without hydromorphone or a paravertebral catheter‐infused bupvicaine. Postoperative visual analog scores and incentive spirometry data were measured in the postanesthesia care unit, the evening of the first operative day, and daily thereafter until postoperative day 4. Analgesia on all postoperative days was superior in the thoracic epidural group receiving bupivacaine plus hydromorphone. Analgesia was similar in the epidural and continuous paravertebral groups receiving bupivacaine alone. No significant improvement was noted by combining the continuous infusion of bupivacaine via the paravertebral and epidural routes. Incentive spirometry goals were best achieved in the epidural bupivacaine and hydromorphone group and equal in the group receiving bupivacaine alone either via epidural or continuous paravertebral infusion. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provided data that fill gaps in the current literature in 3 important areas. First, this study found that thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) with bupivacaine and a hydrophilic opioid, hydromorphone, may provide enhanced analgesia over TEA or continuous paravertebral infusion (CPI) with bupivacaine alone. Second, in the bupivacaine‐alone group, the increased basal rates required to achieve analgesia resulted in hypotension more frequently than in the bupivacaine/hydromorphone combination group, underscoring the benefit of the synergistic activity. Finally, in agreement with previous retrospective studies, the current data suggest that CPI of local anesthetic appears to provide acceptable analgesia for post‐thoracotomy pain.","['Grider, JS', 'Mullet, TW', 'Saha, SP', 'Harned, ME', 'Sloan, PA']",10.1053/j.jvca.2011.09.003
A randomized study on palliative radiation therapy for inoperable non small cell carcinoma of the lung,"Between October 1981 and November 1984, 291 patients with inoperable advanced non‐small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCLC) were randomized to a two‐arm study. Eighteen of 291 defaulted treatment and were excluded from the study. Twenty‐seven of 273 died during treatment; they were invaluable for treatment response but were included in survival analysis. Without correction for lung attenuation 45 Gy/18 fractions/4 1/2 weeks were given in arm 1 and 31.2 Gy/4 fractions/4 weeks were given in arm 2. One hundred twenty‐eight of 273 were included in arm 1 and 145/273 in arm 2. The two arms were comparable in patient age, sex, performance status and symptoms, primary tumor site, histology, stage of the disease, and distribution of metastases and radiation portal size used. Prognosis was poor with an overall median survival of 20 weeks and was similar in both arms. Radiological tumor response was also similar: 53% in arm 1 and 50% in arm 2. However arm 1 was superior than arm 2 in achieving symptom palliation, 71% vs 54%, p less than 0.02. Treatment complications were mild and included mainly radiation oesophagitis and pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Treatments in both arms were equally well tolerated.","['Teo, P', 'Tai, TH', 'Choy, D', 'Tsui, KH']",10.1016/0360-3016(88)90007-7
"Efficacy and safety of pirarubicin plus capecitabine versus pirarubicin plus cyclophosphamide in Chinese node-negative breast cancer patients: a 4-year open-label, randomized, controlled study","This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy with pirarubicin plus capecitabine (AX regimen) in Chinese node‐negative breast cancer (BCa) patients. Two hundred eighty Chinese pT1‐2N0M0 BCa patients under 70 years of age were equally and randomly assigned to receive four cycles of adjuvant therapy with the AX regimen or pirarubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC regimen) between January 2010 and May 2011. End points included overall survival (OS), disease‐free survival (DFS), chemotherapy‐induced toxicities, and quality of life (QoL). The 4‐year DFS (AX vs. AC, 93.6 vs. 92.9 %, P = 0.761) and OS (97.1 vs. 96.4 %, P = 0.965) were similar between the two treatment arms. The AX group, compared to the AC group, experienced significantly less frequent grade III/IV vomiting (11.4 vs. 26.4 %, P < 0.001), whereas the incidence of other grade III/IV chemotherapy‐associated toxicities was comparable between the two groups (all P values >0.05). Use of the AX regimen was associated with significantly higher QoL scores in the domains of physical, role, and social functions than the AC regimen (P values <0.05), although the two regimens were similar in the domains of emotional and cognitive functions (all P values >0.05). In comparison with the AC regimen, AX adjuvant chemotherapy is equally beneficial for node‐negative BCa patients younger than 70 years with respect to OS and DFS. The AX regimen is primarily advantageous over the AC regimen based on less frequent severe toxicities and better health‐related QoL.","['Zhang, X', 'Zhou, Y', 'Mao, F', 'Lin, Y', 'Guan, J', 'Sun, Q']",10.1007/s12032-015-0686-8
"Palliative endobronchial brachytherapy for central lung tumors. A prospective, randomized comparison of two fractionation schedules","AIM OF THE STUDY: Remote high dose rate brachytherapy is an effective local treatment modality for central lung tumors and has the potential to improve survival time. Optimal dose and fractionation schemes have not been identified yet. We conducted a prospective randomized study to compare two treatment schedules in terms of survival time, local tumor control, and possible complications. DESIGN: Group 1 received 4 brachytherapies with a dose of 3.8 Gy (at a 10‐mm depth) on a weekly basis, and group 2 received 2 treatments with 7.2 Gy (at a 10‐mm depth) at a 3‐week interval. At a depth of 5 mm, the calculated doses would be 8 and 15 Gy. This study is still ongoing. Here we report interim results. PATIENTS: Ninety‐three patients with advanced cancer were included in the study; 44 were in group 1 and 49, in group 2. Both groups were comparable regarding age, sex, tumor stage, Karnofsky performance status, and histologic findings. INTERVENTIONS: A mean total irradiation dose of 13.4 +/‐ 5.2 Gy for group 1 and 13.7 +/‐ 4.4 for group 2 were applied (calculated at 10 mm from the source axis, equivalent to 27.9 Gy in group 1 and 28.5 Gy in group 2 at a 5‐mm depth). RESULTS: The 1‐year survival rate was 11.4% in group 1 and 20.4% in group 2. No significant difference in survival time was found, but mean survival was longer in group 2 (49 weeks) than in group 1 (26 weeks). Local control after 3 months was comparable in both groups. Fatal hemoptysis occurred at a similar rate in group 1 (22.2%) and in group 2 (21.1%). CONCLUSION: High‐dose rate brachytherapy with 2 x 7.2 Gy with a 3‐week interval is equivalent to a 4 x 3.8‐Gy regimen on a weekly basis. The shorter treatment schedule is more convenient for patients, does not cause more side effects, and provides an equal local tumor control.","['Huber, RM', 'Fischer, R', 'Haŭtmann, H', 'Pöllinger, B', 'Wendt, T', 'Müller-Wening, D', 'Häussinger, K']",10.1378/chest.107.2.463
Afatinib versus erlotinib as second-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (LUX-Lung 8): an open-label randomised controlled phase 3 trial,"BACKGROUND: There is a major unmet need for effective treatments in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. LUX‐Lung 8 compared afatinib (an irreversible ErbB family blocker) with erlotinib (a reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor), as second‐line treatment for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. METHODS: We did this open‐label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial at 183 cancer centres in 23 countries worldwide. We enrolled adults with stage IIIB or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the lung who had progressed after at least four cycles of platinum‐based‐chemotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive afatinib (40 mg per day) or erlotinib (150 mg per day) until disease progression. The randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice or web‐based response system and stratified by ethnic origin (eastern Asian vs non‐eastern Asian). Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was progression‐free survival assessed by independent central review (intention‐to‐treat population). The key secondary endpoint was overall survival. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01523587. FINDINGS: 795 eligible patients were randomly assigned (398 to afatinib, 397 to erlotinib). Median follow‐up at the time of the primary analysis of progression‐free survival was 6·7 months (IQR 3·1‐10·2), at which point enrolment was not complete. Progression free‐survival at the primary analysis was significantly longer with afatinib than with erlotinib (median 2·4 months [95% CI 1·9‐2·9] vs 1·9 months [1·9‐2·2]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·82 [95% CI 0·68‐1·00], p=0·0427). At the time of the primary analysis of overall survival (median follow‐up 18·4 months [IQR 13·8‐22·4]), overall survival was significantly greater in the afatinib group than in the erloinib group (median 7·9 months [95% CI 7·2‐8·7] vs 6·8 months [5·9‐7·8]; HR 0·81 [95% CI 0·69‐0·95], p=0·0077), as were progression‐free survival (median 2·6 months [95% CI 2·0‐2·9] vs 1·9 months [1·9‐2·1]; HR 0·81 [95% CI 0·69‐0·96], p=0·0103) and disease control (201 [51%] of 398 patients vs 157 [40%] of 397; p=0·0020). The proportion of patients with an objective response did not differ significantly between groups (22 [6%] vs 11 [3%]; p=0·0551). Tumour shrinkage occurred in 103 (26%) of 398 patients versus 90 (23%) of 397 patients. Adverse event profiles were similar in each group: 224 (57%) of 392 patients in the afatinib group versus 227 (57%) of 395 in the erlotinib group had grade 3 or higher adverse events. We recorded higher incidences of treatment‐related grade 3 diarrhoea with afatinib (39 [10%] vs nine [2%]), of grade 3 stomatitis with afatinib (16 [4%] vs none), and of grade 3 rash or acne with erlotinib (23 [6%] vs 41 [10%]). INTERPRETATION: The significant improvements in progression‐free survival and overall survival with afatinib compared with erlotinib, along with a manageable safety profile and the convenience of oral administration suggest that afatinib could be an additional option for the treatment of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
